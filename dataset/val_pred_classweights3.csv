"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.",2,1
Bought this for my wife and she loves it definitely worth it,2,2
Bought this Kindle for our grandchild and he loves it.For anyone who just loves to read this size and weight is perfect!!!!,2,2
So fun and useful. We play with it and rely several task with it.,2,2
"Great for streaming, TV shows! Highly recommend this product!",2,2
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",2,0
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!,2,2

"Excellent Black Friday deal. My 17 year old son was very excited to go to Black Friday, so after Thanksgiving dinner we walked down to Best Buy and were so surprised to find it busy, but organized and easy to see items and find great deals!",2,2

Bought 3 for kids... they stay charged through play all day (7-9 hrs) and have been dropped and slammed a few times already but still look perfect and work just like new,2,2
Always wanted something transportable bedsides my phone. This fits in my purse and is readily accessible for travel. Great product for internet accessibility.,2,2

Very easy to set up. Just plug in and ask her questions. Haven't used parental controls so can't say anything about that.,2,2
"I like the small size and auto adjustable lighted screen. With my old Kindle I needed to have external light to read, but this one comes with the build one.",2,2

For what it does it's great for me a good alternative,2,2

AFTER 3 YEARS WITH A SMALLER AMAZON FIRE THIS ITEM IS A GREAT RELACEMENT. VERY SLEEK DESIGN. OVERALL EASE TO UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL SOFTWARE WAS NICE . VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT,2,0
Much easier to use than the stick.i would recommend .,2,2
Love it! Alexa is Amazing! It is user friendly without touching the speaker.,2,2
The device is amazing the kids love it. It's very easy to use almost like a iPad.,2,2
"I love to read but books were beginning to take over my space! This little ""baby"" is so small and holds a lot of books. Not only that, I can upload a new book any time I want to without leaving my house!",2,2
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load",2,2
My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.,2,2

"This is just the right size and price for my kids. For just playing the games, watching netflix, or just cruising the net, this is a great value.",2,2
I LOVE HOW IT PAYS NO PAUSE MOVIES AND AUDIO LOUD I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR A FRIEND,2,2
Easy to set. Easy to use. So glad I upgraded my Fire Stick to the Fire Tv box.,2,2
Love the speed and the quality of this product. Watch all my shows in great definition.,2,2
Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!,2,2
"I bought this as a gift, and we all tried it out. Setup was pretty easy - download the app, connect it to your wi-fi, and you're off and running from there. Some of the potentially useful things that we saw right off the bat were:* Reading your news headlines in the morning* It feels like a voice-oriented Google search* Getting answers to random questions* Kids are easily entertained by itPersonally, I don't see the need for it - but I can appreciate the convenience and novelty of it.",2,2
"I like how the Amazon Fire TV works consistently. With it being able to be hardwired into my existing network, it fires up and works seamlessly.",2,2
Great product at a great price. Gave out as Safety recognition gifts.,2,2
"My kids love it and use it for everything, including their homework. It is really a great companion.",2,2
Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.,2,2
Love it. Got it for my grandson. Since i have amazon prime. He can watch alot of free movies and games,2,2
Amazing for reading kindle which was my main concern. The cameras are not that amazing & downloding is pretty quick the battery evens last long great quality for its price great gift idea,2,2
This amazon fire 7 tablet is good for web surfing.not so fast but its ok.,2,2
"When Amazon first released this, I couldn't rationalize spending the money to purchase something that could play music, answer questions, report traffic and weather, etc. I did a lot of research before looking into purchasing one because I wanted to start converting my home into a Smart Home. I purchased this along with the Philips Hue and so far, I haven't regretted the purchase. Using the Apps to control the lighting is great but when you can simply use voice commands, it makes it that much more convenient. I would recommend this or any of the other ""echo"" products if you're looking to convert to a Smart Home.",2,2
Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s,2,2
I really like this tablet. Its fast and responsive and just the right size.,2,2
I have been enjoying using my Amazon Echo. It is very satisfying.,2,2
"I already had two DOTS (one connected to my main stereo via the aux line), but I wanted a stand alone Alexa device for a large bathroom suite. No real complaints other than value. I think this should be more like a $129-139 device. The speaker quality is pretty good but I expected something closer to a high end stand alone bluetooth speaker for $179. Still, I don't regret the purchase and I would make it again. One other factor that didn't affect the way I am using it....unlike the DOTS...the ECHO cannot be used with earbuds because it does not have bluethooth sending capabilities.",2,0
Numerous charges of iPhone 6 at 20 degrees or less and still had 3 bars remaining,2,2
Got this for my kids. It does everything they want it to. Great price for what you get. Highly recomend for someone wanting a good tablet that won't break the bank.,2,2
it's very useful and comfortable! I like it so much.,2,2
great tablet.just needs a way to disable ads and stuff like that..if you play alot of games you should get the 16gb one.,2,2
So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips,2,2
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need",2,2
I would recommend this tablet to anyone that is interested in one. It is just as good as a Samsung one and half the price.,2,2
Bought this box and love it. Cut cable and use this with PlayStation Vue. I recommend this over Roku,2,2
More interaction is needed between other devices. Too hard to remember opening statements to get echo to respond.,2,2
This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !,2,2
"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this.",2,2
The Kindle Fire is a good tablet! It is easy to navigate!,2,2
Bought this as a gift for my 5 year old nephew. It is easy for him to use. Downloaded educational games for him to play. Great buy!,2,2
"good,like the larger size screen and able to increase font for easy reading",2,2
"This is my 2nd FireTV I now own, and love them both. Setup was a snap even without it preconfigured from Amazon.",2,2
"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",2,2
"There are so many advantages to the Fire TV box. It has an Ethernet connection and a USB port. Add a wireless keyboard or flash drive. It's got 4K and it is fast. The fire stick is more reasonable priced but it's not as fast and doesn't have any USB or Ethernet connection. If you have a few bucks more, go for the Fire TV box.",2,2
Don't care for the ads on this. But for the price its good. Ads can be removed for 15 bucks through Amazon.,2,2
"The paper white does what it claims it will do.You can go for weeks on end w/ only a single charge and it still have juice. Reading and import documents such as per files are simple via ""drag-n-drop"" in the root folder (which you'll create), documents. I only which that the ability to read .doc .docx files were available rather than having to convert files to pdf format. The screen is gentle to the eyes to read, whether outside in the sun or a low light setting, backlight or not.",2,1
Bought this to replace my old kindl its a bit smaller also easyer to handle,2,2
Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.,2,2
"Never loved or hated one of these before but, it's great cause it works",2,2
All my friends and some family members have and I wantedto join in on the fun of Alexa! The speaker sounds great when playing music. Have linked my lights as well. Lovin my gal Alexa!,2,2
Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - White works great my wife has had the this item for a year and is still going strong. Great way to read books.,2,2
Amazon - Fire Tv is ok. i was thinking it was going to be faster then the Amazon stick.,2,0
"Reading on my commute, or in a waiting room, is a pleasant way to pass time - and convenient",2,2
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read.",2,2
I really like it it's going to very nice sound to it but it's a little bit slower than my echo.for some reason but other than that I really like it,2,2
"I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.",2,2
Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...,1,0
I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.,2,2
Bought this product for grand child and he really likes it. Kept him busy on long trip.,2,2
"Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.",0,0
"I have the Fire Stick and it did not support 4K, so I purchased the Fire TV with my new 4K TV and this unit performs better than my Fire Stick. There is not much waiting between clicks and it supports 4K!",2,2
"Bought the original Kindle Fire, and was impressed with the latest updated version. Better software, camera, and more apps make this all the more worth the small price. I guess that Amazon takes a loss on the production of this unit to gain your interest in buying their merchandise and using their services. In any case, it works, and I would recommend this to anyone interested in an inexpensive internet access device.",2,2
I enjoy the convenience of the size and the ease of reading with this reader.,2,2
"I love having music playing constantly. I bought the echo for the dining room and the dot for my master bath! ! Love love love them. Also i haven't made a shopping list since I've had them and haven't forgotten random ""stuff"" i need.",2,2
"Got this on sale and it's very good, the interface is easy to use and super easy to set up",2,2
I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!,2,2
Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera,2,2
"The product is as advertised. I have good internet and it works great. Was able to ""cut the cord"" and save a good bit of money.",2,2
"I was so pleased with my Amazon TV Stick on my guest room TV, that I purchased the Amazon TV for my other TV. Awesome!! Awesome!! With those and the Google ChromeCast, I have the world of entertainment at my finger tips.",2,2
"Perfect gift for my dad, he loves to read. He is in love with Kindle.",2,2
I need more learning but I'm coming along.Sirii is better. Music is great on the echo.,2,2
This probably the most amazing electronic device I have in the home. Only thing that would make it better was if I could connect it to sound bar for a little better sound but this thing will answer almost anything. Well worth the money. Everyone should have at least one - we have 2 now and will buy more.,2,2
I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,1,2
"Friendly user systen, easy to setup, good size to put in a bag",2,2
Much better than it he earlier Kindles no more messing with lights,2,2
Item is a replacement for one that was starting to go back. It works fine.,2,2
"I previously had a standard Kindle...the battery would no longer hold the charge. I wanted to replace it but be able to read in dim light. This feature is great. I chose the paperwhite because the screen did not glare like the Fire. It took some getting used to since it is all touch screen, but it has a few better features than the original. One complaint is that it sometime jumps further ahead than one page, so you need to pay attention when moving to the next page. I recommend it for someone who wants to use it for reading only.",2,2
"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it.",2,2
My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly,2,2
"Very cool product. Easy setup and very easy to use. Setup was fast, especially if you already have a Amazon account.",2,2
"I got this because I saw it on Amazon.com. I the. Went to BB just to see if they had it in stock. I fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it was good enough to spend the $50 on. If I didn't want it I could give it to my mom or something. This thing has really impressed me. I have an iPad and an iPhone 6s. The kindle isn't near the performance of those guys but I was looking to step outside my ecosystem and just get a feel for something new. Besides, Amazon can do no wrong. Bottom line is that it's a greater starter tablet...something to have on the nightstand and let the company use.",2,0
"I bought this tablet for my children, I love it for its parental control settings as well as how fast it is. The volume is louder than many other tablets I have handled, which makes it great for watching videos or game play. I would definitely recommend this product and would purchase it again",2,2
"This is the best tablet in it's category at a price point which everyone can afford. Big thanks to Amazon for making this possible. The user experience is very good and there are enough number of apps to play around including the must haves like Facebook,Youtube ,Netflix etc.",2,2
This kindle is by far the best one I've had. I have zero complaints.,2,2
"It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet",2,2
I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,1,2
Alexa will simplify your life. Give her a chance and you will be glad you did.,2,2
The kids love it and easy to understand. Great parental controls as well.,2,2
"The tablet is nice, it is good for the price, lot of apps available and easy to use",2,2
"Can't beat the price these are going for, gets the job done.",2,2
"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",1,2
My grandkids plays with this tablet all the time.lots of videos and games,2,2
This is a great device. Easy to install easy to use.,2,2
WHAT DID WE DO BEFORE ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY? I LOVE THE ECHO! THE SOUND AND FEATURES ARE AMAZING!,2,2
Great tablet for the money Would buy another Easy to use,2,2
I really wanted to buy this kindle paperwhite and I can't be happier. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting for a e-book reader. Really nice product really love it!,2,2
"Alexia - I love you!! Controls the lights, saves my shopping list, timer, plays music plus so much more...",2,2
"We purchased the Amazon Echo as a family gift, it has had great reviews so far.",2,2
Sound production is outstanding!! Very easy to set up and use!,2,2
"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!",2,2
I had to buy this item due to the store no longer having the Firestick in the store. Set up was easy and dry easy to use.,2,2
Bought this as a Christmas gift. My daughter loves it. She specifically likes the screen lighting.,2,2
Good quality tablet. This tablet could be a bit more user friendly but once u get going by pushing a view apps you can find most of what your looking for.,2,2
Just got my kindle and am just getting use to it. Like it so far.,2,2
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet.",2,2
Bought this for my mom who is in her 70's. It's perfect and easy to use for the older generation.,2,2
"I had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. Lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. Overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite.",2,2
Excellent product especially for price. Used by my younger daughter.,2,2
I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It was easy to set up and I have absolutely no complaints. I reviewed different e-readers and decided on the paperweight because I could read it outside with no issues. I have tested it in the bright sun light and had no problem with any glare. Even with the sun shining directly on it.,2,2
"What a GREAT PRICE!! This one is a lot different from the one I am replacing. I, personally, don't think it's as user friendly. But there's nothing that can be done about that. I only use it for books, nothing else.",2,2
"With Amazon Fire TV, you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. Find favorites quickly or access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search...",2,2
I like the size of it and it's easy to operate. I didn't like that I had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information. I need to have wifi to look at the stuff I downloaded and I don't like that. But for the cost it's ok.,1,2
It was very easy to download and read the books in the tablet,2,2
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages.",2,2
a birthday gift for my son and he likes it. always attached to his hand and always on it.,2,2
"Use to do everyday questions. What's the time,weather,addtoo shop list, check calendar and all kinds of little things without having to open computer lying in bed.",2,2
Works great. Is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle. Terrific for low light reading.,2,2
"Very good quality price ratio!We buy this table for a little kid for a very low price and it's one of best deal for a very long time....Again, very good for their low price.",2,2
"Great and clear looking screen, with a 3d effect. Easy set up. Loving it!!",2,2
"Unfortunately, Alexa is still complicated to get it to recognize smart devices.",1,2
"2nd one I've bought as a gift, can't go wrong! Will probably end up buying another!",2,2
I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since,2,2
Like all amazon stuff i have used these things are great built insanly well and eith a reasonable price tag way better then any of the rokus i have tried.,2,2
returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.,1,2
"The sound is good, worth a try. The minus thing is they need to improve the voice recognize",2,2
"Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way.",2,2
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...,2,2
"This Fire TV is perfect for my intended use, I have cut the cable with the big cable companies and plan to use this for a long time.",2,2
"This is lots of fun, you can ask it what to wear, play you a song, your calendar, all while you're doing other things. So there is no wasted time, however I am not sure of the Privacy part of it. I think it is always listening and we will start to get marketed due to what we talked about at the dinner table",2,2
"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge.",2,2
I bought the Echo for my 30 year old daughter. She loves it. Very useful and works great. Easy to use.,2,2
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.,2,2
tablet was easy to set up and get started. 80 year old mother loves it!,2,2
If you have decided to buy a digital assistant this is the one to choose. Google home is good but not nearly as refined as Alexa. I have used both extensively and the Echo is the hands down winner.,2,2
"I needed something new for my bathroom, love to sing in the morning. Love to listen to the radio getting dressed, hear the morning news and traffic. Great for winding down in the evenin with some jazz in a bubble bath.",2,2
"I paid $35 for this unit right before Christmas. I have had an iPad mini2 for 3 years and this is not as user friendly, but for $35 now when traveling I have a 2nd streaming device. Perfect for kids/streaming.",2,2
"The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price.",2,1
"Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the ""FIRE""",2,2
"So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad.",1,2
It was given to my friend as a gift. I hope he likes it.,1,2
very easy to use and the battery life is execellent,2,2
Great gift for the family and friends. I have purchased several.,2,2
My wife loves the tablet.it is light weight !!!!!!,2,2
It's voice activated capability is nice but not that responsive when the volume is full. You have to keep your voice loud so it can hear you.What is also nice is how it learns and can have multiple profile for family.,2,2
A great streaming device that I use on a daily basis.,2,2
"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read.",2,2

"very easy to set-up. a big hit a parties, excellent speaker.",2,2

You can't beat a color HD tablet for $50. Go buy one now!,2,2
"Aside from being about the only eink readers still available, the Amazon Kindle series of readers offer bang for the buck, and features that you don't know you need. The Paperwhite reader is great in sunlight, in a lit room, or even in a darkened room. The available Kindle books offer a tremendous variety of genres and titles for a low cost. And with shareware converters like calibre, classics available through public domain are all there to be read. If you love books, then this is for you.",2,2
"I liked Amazon Fire TV, it's powerful and the result is amazing.",2,2

It is a very good product and the attention of employees was very good,2,2

Bought this for my daughter and she uses it all the time. I highly recommend it!DD,2,2
"I love the size of the kindle. It is great to be able to put it in my purse. Also, main reason is I need to read outside sometimes and need to use sunglasses. The white paper make is real easy to read.",2,2
Bought this for my mother who is not so savvy with tablets but this one made it easy for her to use.,2,2
After several attempts to get help from Roku with no resolution I gave up and bought an Amazon Fire TV. This is by far the easiest to use. Love it!!!,2,2
it works that what counts,2,2
Love my Amazon Echo! Does all sorts of really cool things.,2,2

"Really the best cheap tablet out there.It's equally great for those inclined to hack it and make it even more useful, and anyone who want a simple tablet. Works best if you have Amazon Prime.",2,2
"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker and this was perfect. I think in order to get the full benefits its best to be a prime member so you can link your account and use prime music but also be able to utilize the tools like shopping list, checking past orders, etc. the only downside is it's not wireless. I know Amazon has made one that is wireless but I like the design of the echo.",2,2
This is a great starter tablet for kids and adults alike. It's always at a great price and works beautifully.,2,2
"Readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like camera(not very good), calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. I didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps I use the most on my cellphone. It is good for the price anyways...",1,2
"This is the best thing I have ever bought, has amazing sound better than my Bose, she gives answers to your questions is fun to have takes very little space Love it",2,2
"I have this paired with my Samsung Smart Things, WEMO devices, Smart Light Bulbs (LIFX and Sengled). She is pretty witty and very fun to mess around with and understands you even with music or TV on at loud volumes. I love the features and can't wait for more compatible devices to come out.",2,2
This is really a neat innovative tool. Would order,2,2
"It's great, but not too much memory. Bonus I was told that I could add a memory stick. Haven't done it yet, but like the possibility.",2,2
This device is so cool. I must buy for all gadget guys.,2,2
"Great e-reader, long battery life. Was hesitant to make the change from actual books to an e-reader but I have no regrets!",2,2
This Amazon Fire TV box works as advertised. It was a breeze to set up and took me about five minutes to figure out how to use the features and functions.,2,2
A nice hands-free versatile piece of technology to have in the house.,2,2
Amazon TV is on par with Apple TV. I especially like toe original programming that Amazon offers.,2,2
Love it the size easy to carry and store would recommend to others,2,2
This is a great value for the money. With Amazon's apps for kids it has been alot of fun and easy to use.,2,2
"Purchased the Echo for my wife for Christmas. She loves to use it throughout the day asking questions, playing music and adding items to her shopping list. It is very useful and also easy to set up and use.",2,2
"This is the best 7"" tablet out there for under $50 - perhaps the best tablet for under $100. It is fast and reliable",2,2
We had 1 fire tablet and we bought 2 more as gifts. We truly love these tablets. Very great purchase. Easy setup and use,2,2
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.,2,2
"I really like my new Echo, which I received for Christmas. Love the fact that you can get the weather report, news, add items to your grocery list and listen to various music. You can find answers to questions without having to google it. I like it better than Siri.",2,2
Works smooth as butter. Better than chrome cast. All,2,2
I use my fire tv daily and it performs perfectly. I have a smart tv but the fire tv runs much faster.,2,2
"I'm a huge fan of these tablets. If you aren't trying to spend a lot of money, or if you aren't an avid daily user, this will easily do all the basic necessities",2,2
"Very good for in bed watching of Amazon Prime shows. Not as fast as other options, but excellent for the price.",2,2
Works perfect and the price is right for my needs.,2,2
I love this little gadget. Alexa is fun and informative!. A great addition to the family.,2,2
"Love Alexa!!!!! She plays our music on command, keeps shopping and to do lists, gives weather reports etc. Every day I am learning more that she can do. Love it.",2,2
I am not too happy with the Kindle. It's ok but it seems to run slow and sometimes the sd card isn't reading. Would not purchase another,1,0
first tablet ive ever bought works great for reading,2,2
"My old Kindle Fire got pushed into the water by my cat, so I bought a new one. It's OK, but nothing to write home about. Kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward.....too narrow. It'll do, and the price is right, but if you can afford more, buy a better tablet.",1,0
I bought the Kindle Fire after I upgraded my primary tablet to a 10 inch. The 10 inch was too big to take to a coffee shop to read or to use outside. This is perfect size. I put a 2gb as card in it to hold my books. I can down load a couple of books and take it on the road.,2,2
"Bought this for a friend. It does the job (basic web and book reading) and at an affordable price. Nothing too fancy, but no problems.",1,2
I wanted to get my kids a tablet and this was the best option..Glad I made this decision my kids love the kindle,2,2
Before I switched to the Kindle white I was using Barnes and Noble Nook which had several down sides compared to the Kindle. Kindle battery last a long time compared to the Nook. Kindle does not jump pages like the Nook. Nook is very sensitive to touch and causes a lot of confusion when trying to find where you left off reading. My husband and I are very happy that we switched to Kindle especially since you have a greater selection of reading material through Amazon.,2,2
"Great addition for those that are building onto your smart home. Great connection with nest, hue lights and august lock. Have two dots as well. Great machines!",2,2
"I bought 3 for my three granddaughters for Christmas. They love it. I love it too, free games, books, movies",2,2
"I absolutely love this devise. I do wish ti was more compatible with more things, but it is still well worth it!!",2,2
I loved this product. Excellent for the price. so much you can do on this. Also excellent for kids.,2,2
"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.",2,2
"It's okay. When hooked up to my tv wirelessly, there seems to be a lot of lag. Seems to work better hard wired.",1,0
Had my first kindle (the original) for many years when I lost it. Love my new Kindle PaperWhite. Can read in the dark.,2,2
"Amazon is at the forefront of 4K content, offering several shows in HDR. Then why isn't their very own streaming player capable of displaying it? And at only 30 fps to boot. This was obviously built to a price but if you've already shelled out the money for a 4K TV wouldn't you want it to be able to display all that it's capable of? The Roku is, at present, the far superior product.",0,2
granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.,2,2
Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.,0,0
"This is extremely easy to use, packed with abilities, and has internet capabilities. I can't believe all of this for such a low price. This is the only tablet anyone needs.",2,2
"This is my second tablet, my daughter love it, just the perfect gift.",2,2
Great for listening to music. You save alot of time on the internet just asking your questions to Alexa.,2,2
For $50 i wasnt expecting high end screen resolution.,1,2
"The Amazon Fire tablet is easy to use, easy to download books, and I love it",2,2
"Good tablet. Keeps my neice busy for hours, and we usually have to take it from her so she can sleep.",2,2
Great for an inexpensive tablet for around the house.,2,2
The uses for this item was worth every penny. 99$ was a small price to pay.,2,2
Just bought as a travel companion. Something to watch movies and play games on. So far it has been great. The picture is great. It's really clear.,2,2
I love this. It's has so much to offer for a great price. Super fast and easy to use!,2,2
"I use Alexa for fun facts, listening to music and telling weather. I also use it to turn on and off some Wemo lights I installed. I bought this one as a gift for a close friend, and she loves it too.",2,2
My kid enjoys watching his cartoons on the fire tv,2,2
Great price. Maybe too small for those who need reading glasses but refuse to wear them during usage of tablet.,2,2
It was pretty cheap and you can surf the web. a good buy for the bucks.,2,2
Love the product. And the place I would recommend them to everyone.,2,2
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it.",2,2
Echo is fun to have but does not offer all I thought it would. Difficult to get answers to simple questions,2,2
It gets the job done...................Great to buy......,1,2
I would not know where to start. It is the best among the the field of Android TV. Voice call is second to none. I have recommended it to more than 3 of my frieds.,2,2
This is prerfict for my kids and my needs! We love reading the books and when a game is wanted or watching Netflix it is so easy!,2,2
"The Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) works really well, the only negative thing is my remote stopped working after the first day, but I downloaded the app on my phone and it works really well., I have the box behind my tv, and have no problem controlling it with my phone.",2,2
Highly recommend purchasing as a starter tablet and/or for a younger child. Internet access through Silk Browser and most common apps available through App Store.,2,2
Have not received mine but have spent many hours with my friends it really is amazing great fun.,2,2
Alexa is always learning and Amazon is adding new functions but sometimes (like all of the voice assistants) she sometimes can't understand the request.,2,2
Very good tablet for my daughter she has really enjoyed it,2,2
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.,2,2
Great device for cable cutters. I just wish it had vudu.,2,2
Whether if you have cable or not (we don't)- this is an amazing device to have. Many movies to choose from.,2,2
"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer...",2,2
We have spotty radio reception so going through the internet is ideal. I could have done the same thing with a speaker for about the same price. However this is more versatile as I can send messages to others and make lists plus more features are being added all the time!!,2,2
"Excellent product, I use it for everything, especially for music and weather.",2,2
Just bought his a week ago. It works great in recognizing our voices and commands.,2,2
I use my Amazon fire TV as a replacement for my cable box. I have an Amazon prime membership and I watch their content plus I use the service sling to watch live TV.,2,2
Great reading experience. All your books in one place. Compact. Excellent!!,2,2
"I use Alexa all the time to set temperature, water the lawn, play music. This is definitely a product worth having if you have a smart home.",2,2
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.,2,2
We love it (that's me & my wife) . My son & daughter-in law & 2 grand-girls all love it.,0,2
I purchased this for my brother in law who just needed something to surf the web. Set up was easy and he was on the internet within minutes of unboxing.,2,2
All the icons on the tablet works just fine. I got help,2,2
"My first kindle paperwhite lasted several years, and I used it a lot! When it quit, I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased another one. After only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. I could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. I went back to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a new one. If it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. I thought the Kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. This time, I bought the insurance plan. Best Buy treated me great. There was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund. Even though I did not have my original receipt, only had my charge card bill, there was not a problem.",2,1
It did not meet my expectations and was pretty slow.,1,0
Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.,2,2
Very nice and efficient gadget that is so user friendly that even our young kids love to use,2,2
Enjoy the fun facts each morning...also use it in the morning to find out the results of the late night baseball scores,2,2

"Got this tablet for $35 for an older family friend and it is simple to use. Certainly doesn't have a ton of capability, but is more than adequate for basic email, web surfing and taking photos/videos.",2,2
"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.",2,2
This works wonderful. We cancelled Direct tv and went with is instead. Love it.,2,2
Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.,2,2
"My 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. He did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. He can connect to our home Wi Fi to access the internet, You Tube and games. We monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. This is much smaller than an iPad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. I bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet.",2,1
This is a great buying experience from bestbuy. delivery is so fast and the product is amazing. Thumbs up for this product and bestbuy.,2,2
"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",2,2
my grandson loves it plays it all time loves the app. store,2,2
Got these for my 4 and 11 year old on Black Friday when they were 34$. Typically our household is Apple only. But I couldn't justify buying another iPad. Works great. Not as many of her favorite apps as the iPad but still a hit.,2,2
"This Kindle is much lighter than my old 2nd generation Kindle. The ads are no problem at all, as they only appear when the Kindle is in sleep mode. The back light is great, so is the price!",2,2
This device has done everything my family has asked if it and easy enough for my kids to not have to teach me how to use it,2,2
"I am a teacher and was looking for an inexpensive way for my students play educational games. So far, they are working as I hoped.",2,2
It is very light and easy to handle. It fits the rack on my treadmill without blocking heart rate info. Took some getting used to but now I like the new home page which shows front cover of the book.,2,2
I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.,2,2
I bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it!,2,2
"the perfect gift, excellent price good device !!!!",2,2
i love the alexa voice service i can turn on my lights and order pizza with my voice through the fire tv.. the apps are the same as any other media device.. games are good too..,2,2
"Sound is good. Very convenient for getting weather, setting alarms, news updates. Alexa sounds so much like a real person. Love that!",2,2

No glare anywhere--even on the beach! Also you can read in the dark with no problems.,2,2

"My husband and I have had a great time checking out all the fun features of the Echo. We are very impressed with the instantaneous answers to our questions. What a fun ""toy.""",2,2

"I have purchased 4 Kindle Fire 7 tablets for my grandsons, and they love playing games on them whether they are educational games or just-for-fun games.",2,2
The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,2,1
"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working.",2,2
The amazon echo is a great the voice recognition works fantastic,2,2
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.,2,2
"This product is great for all members in the family. . My kids ask questions about homework, my husband loves the radio and I love the the current news.",2,2
I love the size and features of the Kindle Paperwhite.,2,2
Bought as a gift ... Great high quality tablet for the money.,2,2
Excellent sound and great value. Used every day by entire family.,2,2
I bought one of these for my father. He loves it and I noticed it is very well built like if it was built the same way as the Amazon Fire box which I am very impressed by how well built it is. Even the battery terminals are polished chrome tabs. I mean come on what company goes to that much trouble. The charger reminded be of an I-phone charger. Impressed by this little tablet I will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future. Good product for the buck!,2,2
Good tablet at a good price. Great for your basic tasks.,2,2
I'm so happy with my purchase! Very easy to install. Love the interface. Well priced. Haven't had any issues.,2,2
Nice product for the money. Bought for an elderly person. Hope she will like it as I do!,2,2
We have joined the modern world and now have access to more viewing opportunities than we imagined. The best part is that this technology allows us to speak our request.,2,2
"Awesome battery, does every thing I need it to. I love it.",2,2
Good just complicated too many apps to download...,1,2
"BOUGHT ON BLACK FRIDAY FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE THOUGHT I PAID 100.00 MORE FOR IT. IT DOES A LOT. SHE LOVES IT.",2,0
I have 3 Roku devices and I'm totally impressed by this. Amazon hit it out of the park!,2,2
Great for watching movies when traveling. Perfect for watching on an airplane.,2,2
It is a great tablet. Both of my kids have one. Would buy another one.,2,2
Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.,2,2
It's a kindle...great kindle for a great price. Expandable memory can be used to expand your movie or game library. It also has great sound and picture quality.,2,2
Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend,2,2
The sound is good and voice volume control is real nice. There are skills you need to find to do really so much. Learning what to say is getting better for me. I plan on buying a dot next.,2,2
This item is great. I would buy it again. Highly recommended.,2,2
We've been a FIRE fan since day-one and this one does not disappoint! Get it! You won't regret it!,2,2
"Very small and handy, very easy to use, and Perfect for travel.",2,2
makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,2,2
My mother in law was so happy to get this tablet. She cried when she opened our gift at Christmas. It is easy to use and easy to navigate. She is a first time tablet user at almost 70 years old.. And has never used a smartphone either..she now spends most of her time on it. Great tablet for the price. Definitely recommend,2,2
My granddaughter loves this. It is perfect for her to play her games and entertain herself for a long time.,2,2
For the price this tablet can't be beat. My wife mostly uses it 4 reading and Amazon shopping. It does everything she needs it to do. Battery life is very good as well.,2,2
"Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy",2,2
"The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!",2,2
"This streaming content box packs a lot of punch for it's size. Very responsive to your commands whether using handheld remote or voice activation. Very easy to set up, register, and use.Some of the content is a little misleading as you need to look for the prime banner otherwise you have to purchase to watch which was a surprise for me as when I saw all the selections, I was excited about all the offerings. Some of the movies I wanted to see, weren't even available. But there is still plenty of other stuff to watch. I'll give it a year trial to see if its really worthwhile, but seems ok so far when you bring music content and free 2 day shipping into the package.",2,2
The perfect gift paired with an amazon gift card for books and a case,2,2
Great for kids that mostly play games and stream videos.,2,2
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.,2,2
I would recommend this buy. Better than the firestick.,2,2
This Tablet is awesome. Easy to set up and navigate.Compact. Easy to hold.,2,2
"great for the price, did research and found this #",2,2
Got 3 on Black Friday for as gifts. My parents loved it and they manage to set it up by themselves so it's definetly user friendly,2,2
This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps.Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. Works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display. This is a must-have item for $50.,2,2
"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it.",2,2
Not a bad product but you only need this if your streaming or viewing 4k content on a 4k tv,2,2
"First off you can't go wrong with the price, $50 (or if you can even catch it on sell) is a steal for any piece of Tech. Now I've seen people compare this to an ipad or samsung tablet, which you can't. This doesn't have retina display or anything like that, But for the price point it does a good job. I've had mine since the black firday sell and its still been working really good. I also got one for my mom and my nephew. I generally use mine for emails and amazon orders along with reading the time to time book, netflix, and the few games that I've purchased. My mom and nephew use it mainly to play games. If your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod features and don't mind the extra $150 or $300 bucks by all means I suggest getting one of the higher end tablets. But I can't complain with this new Amazon fire 7 as it works just as good for me. I'd recommend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space.",2,0
Allows my teens to access apps and Internet while still reading on down time between games,2,2
"I absolutely love Alexa (the wake-up name for the Echo). She tells me a funny fact every morning after I say ""Alexa, good morning"" then I tell her to play my favorite wake-up song(Good Morning Starshine) followed by the local weather and morning news. I get free music all day long from Amazon Prime and I can always hear a Chuck Norris joke. The sound quality is amazing, comparable to a Bose system and it was perfect for our last party. I get updates all the time for new stuff Alexa can do. I love my Echo and find it endlessly fascinating!",2,2
I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it. I just wished I would have bought him the next size up.,2,2
Cheap tablet that pretty much does everything!!!!!,2,2
Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,2,2
We have other Kindle Fire tablets and were wanting to purchase one for our granddaughter for Christmas. She loves this tablet and is a great fit for her.,2,2
"It is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. Can't erase the entire history. It keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it. Amazon selling ALL the time is very tiresome. I never go to an ad that follows me from site to site yet it's ubiquitous. Tiresome. Had the fire 8.9 hdx. It was Perfect and they discontinued it for this line. It is a fingerprint magnet! Have to clean it daily.",1,0
"Whether you need the weather, information about something, a recipe or even just music, the Echo is right there to help. I haven't even used a third of the ability of the Echo but am very impressed with what I have used.",2,2
"I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a",2,2
Really like the echo. This is my second one. I put this one in the kitchen. I got this one because of the size and needed one to be centrally located in my house.,2,2
"This is a awesome tablet. For the price it is a awesome tablet. It is perfect size to play games. Though little small for watching videos, it works perfect for daily use.",2,2
Very smooth and easy to use. I would buy another..,2,2
This was a purchase for Christmas! Great tablet to surf the web or read books on! Would recommend for any age!,2,2
My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.,2,2
So user friendly that I had it for over a month before I read the owners guide to learn all the other features. Makes reading a book effortless. A must have for the avid book reader.,2,2
"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny",2,2
The Amazon Echo is not bad. She seems pretty intelligent but sometimes she doesn't seem to understand simple questions.,2,2
"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application.",1,0
While it doesn't understand everything we say it still is cool and plays most songs we think of.,2,2
"Really enjoy using this. Great for adding groceries to a list or, with additional equipment, turning on lights. Listening to music or the news, I use this more than originally thought.",2,2
It was a great purchase for my grandson. He enjoys the tablet and it seems to be easy for him to use.,2,2
"For the price, I feel like if you complain about anything, you're just going to sound crazy. I got this on Black Friday special, which was awesome. I use this for home automation and playing clash of clans. If you're big into Amazon stuff, this also has a nice selection of amazon apps.",2,2
"Is easy to use, great to look up words you dont know as you go along.Its also great that the light isnt shone up into your eyes, it makes it so that they dont get easily tired and they dont hurt.",2,2
We have gotten rid if cable and just use the fire sticks. What a big savings from the high price of cable.,2,2
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!,2,2
I love being able to tell Alexa to turn off the lights when I have forgotten to turn them off.,2,2
"This is my first tablet and I think it is wonderful. I can do so much on it and I use it everywhere I go. It's the perfect size for me because it fits in my lunch bag and my apron pocket at work. I can do all the same things on it as I do on my laptop computer except edit spreadsheets and text docs. However, I can view them on the tablet.",2,2
"Bought this for someone over 70 who likes to learn new things. Works great and keeps them on their toes for sure. It is fun and helpful, everyone ended up loving it.",2,2
"I bought this Amazon Fire to replace the one I had. My old one need to have the power button replaced and the cost to do that was more than what I paid for the new one. I like that I can take pictures (which I couldn't do with my old one) and it feels lighter. I can read my books, check my email and surf the web. The only negative thing is that I still haven't figure out how to print from it. It was a lot easier from the old one. I'm still exploring all the apps that are preloaded.",2,2
"Great product.i can stream almost anything.Netflix Hulu, you name it.this product is the best.",2,2
I needed a tablet which I can use without worrying about damaging it. This is perfect for that purpose.,2,2
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it.",2,2
ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ITEM. UPLOAD ANYTHING FAST!!,2,1
Purchased 5 of these for my grandkids ages from 4-9. They were all able to work the tablet easily.,2,2
Easy to use this device and the sound is great. We continue to find new ways to use it,2,2
"Not quite as accurate as the commercials imply, but good for music and ""parlor"" tricks like asking sillly questions.",2,2
"I purchased this item during the Black Friday at Best Buy, not only was it dirt cheap at the time of the purchase, But my kids also love it as well. The great thing is that I am also able to monitor what they download and purchase without me having to get the tablet.",2,2
"This device is perfect for converting that ""dumb"" TV in your home to a ""smart"" one. Also, perfect for that TV that has limited apps. This comes with everything!",2,2
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad.",2,2
the echo helps me keep tract of daily and monthy events..Hoping later to use it to play music and use it to make the house more efficent.,2,2
I enjoy it it connect fast it's small but I needed something I can put on my purse,2,2
Easy to use Does a good job of voice recognition,2,2
I purchased 2 one for my wife the other for my college aged daughter both are enjoying the product immensely !,2,2
Good product.......................................,2,2
I tend to use this ore than my ipad. this has got to be the best bargain for a fully functional tablet I have ever seen. I now have three of these devices and may get another.,2,2
Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,0,0
I love the picture quality and the voice feature on the remote is priceless. Would buy again!!!,2,2
My wife thought tablet was to bright this more like reading book. Keeps charge alot longer and works with amazon prime. So this very good purchase at very good price!!!,2,2
i was hesitant about the echo i used att a friends house loved it,2,2
Bought this fire for someone as a Christmas gift and it was the best gift given that day. It is perfect for any small online tasks one would like to do and absolutely perfect for reading books!,2,2
"Echo is amazing. Takes a few days for her to learn , then seems to take on a personality. A little disappointed to start with but downloaded apps and Alexa is fun! Pretty much a toy. Here but can answe questions play music just a fun extension to a computer. Kids love it and so does my husband.",2,2
This a great product for everyone. I would recommend it,2,2
Got this as a birthday gift for my wife..she loved it!,2,2
Bought it for my mother. She works at a beauty salon so she's always busy. Echo works great for her. She loves it. Works great on her galaxy s7,2,2
This product should get product of the year award it is the most amazing piece of technology I have purchased this year it can control your schedule play music from Pandora and I heart radio controlled the lights in my home turned the TV on and off with voice commands so far I haven't seen anything else quite like this it's absolutely amazing.,2,2
"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet",1,0
"I have to admit, I have not used the Echo has much as I should. But anytime I use it I really like it. I simply forget to use it. What I do like is using the timer.",2,2
"Unless you have fiber optic internet, don't buy this. If you have ATT Uverse it will mess up the TV, lower the speed of your internet, and play havoc with the phone.It has not worked yet since getting it, since I only have 25mgb of internet, and it really does not work at that speed at all.",0,0
Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded,2,2
Ready to buy another pleased with item overall easy to use,2,2
"Great image quality, fast device. Jumped to this from Nook and would never go back.",2,2
i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.,2,2
I bought three tablets for my children of various ages. They play with it everyday. It was difficult to find apps that are similar to Google Play. I did find some apps that they enjoy.pros: easy to usecons: it take time to find apps that you really want if you are use to the google play store.,2,2
"If one is new to tablets, this little table is a good introduction to the tablet world. Much can be learned and accomplished for the small investment. Try one!",2,2
"Its a great tablet, mostly use for web browsing and book reading. Great value!",2,2
It 's the perfect gift for a senior who has never owned a computer but understands the cellphone.,2,2
Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems,2,2
"I love how light and convenient it is to carry around. This is beyond worth it for an avid eBook purchaser. I signed up to Prime for my son and none of the chapter books that he really wanted were ever available - not an issue with the kindle - just content that would be relevant for subscription (ie kid magazines) aren't necessarily available on the Paperwhite. Just remember, it's not a tablet, which is lovely if you only want some good uninterrupted reading.",2,2
Very great purchase. She gives the weather and sports,2,2
This is my third kindle. I mainly bought this one so that I would be able to read on the beach.So far I really like it.,2,2
My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.,2,2
Wonderful and fast little tablet. It already servesany uses...,2,2
Do not know why I did not think about getting one of these earlier. This is one we just leave around for anyone to use as the price is so great and most of us use it for internet and playing. have not gotten the chance to read a book on it yet but hoping that will change in the new year.,2,2
Don't waste money on the kid program friendly ones that's what Locks are for,2,2
I haven't had any issues so far with my tablet. The only downside I am aware of is that I can't use it outdoors without getting a lot of glare.,2,1
I upgraded from the fire stick to this. The fire tv runs much faster than my fire stick. Great product.,2,2
A must have in every house . My wife uses it every day,2,2
I upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old Kindle died. I like the paperwhite screen. I hate that the pop up adds and recommendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history. It's very different from earlier Kindles so I'm still learning features. I can't understand why the paperwhite costs 2-3 times what the Kindle Fire costs.,2,2
Definitely the best streaming box in the market especially the new 4K version. I love this box better than Apple box.,2,2
"This is my second Echo. If you have a smart home, you need thus. It's the brains.",2,2
I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.,2,2
"This is a great little tablet. I can go on line, watch movies, check email, play games and more.",2,2
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV. I like both first and second versions of the AFTV, unless your programming is broadcast in 4K, you won't notice the picture quality of the two versions. It has all the Apps you will need and available to sideload if it's not available thru Amazon. Voice command only works with downloaded Apps. Overall, I like AFTV over 3rd Gen Apple TV....",2,2
"At first I didn't think this equipment was of much value when someone pointed it out to me. However after I got to thinking about it, I considered how much easier it would be to use as opposed to the keyboard. After using it, I've found that's not only is it much easier & faster, it's much more accurate as well.",2,2
I own a FIRE HD tablet. It is a good handy device to have. Simple to operate and works great for what I need. I bought this as a gift to my nephew for Christmas - and he is enjoying it too. Great device for a very affordable price.,2,2
Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice,2,2
"There will be a learning curve when you take it out of the box. Once you learn the correct way to say a command, it is nice unit to use. And those jokes - they're groaners that will bring a smile to your face. Sleep timer is a nice feature. ""Alexa"" does not like it when you speak in a loud voice - you must talk to her in a normal voice.",2,2
works and is light,2,2
Nephew loved to play games and listen to music. He never puts it down. Very good buy.,2,2
We bought the tablet for my 1 year old who normally uses my iPad and Samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we could have ours. He was very disengaged. I believe it's because it didn't have the home and back button like our tablets do. Over all it's an amazing device it just didn't keep our little one entertained,2,2
The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight and simple to use! I love my kindle! It looks just like I'm reading a regular book but I don't have to worry about flipping pages I just slide my finger or tap!,2,2
This thing is great for music and gave a group of my friends quite an entertaining evening playing with Amazon echo.,2,2
"Got this one for black friday, no complains at all, the price its great, and the tablet its worth it, now i connect my fire stick easily",2,2
"This is my second Kindle. And again bought just a basic reader. For the convenience, choice of reading materials, comfort of reading, a Kindle can not be beat.",2,2
"My wife and I both enjoyed our Kindle Voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. This is our first E-reader, and it could not be more user-friendly. It works well in all kinds of environments and lighting conditions. A definite winner!",2,2
Good product other than having to purchase additional apps for it to work.,2,2
I really like the echo but I am still trying to find out what else it can do for me. I do plan on getting the controllable lights and thermostat down the road but in the mean time it is still limited. Overall great idea.,2,2
over all it worked. was slower than my kindle paperwhite,2,2
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.,2,2
this is perfect size for my grandson - plays the games and stores all the things he needs to do to solve all fights with his brother,2,2
comes with tons of stuff and you can download a ton more best money I've spent in a while,2,2
Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.,2,2
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,2,2
"Great device. Some limitations, but she is not God.",2,2
My kid loves this tablet. not expensive and the battery lasts a long time.,2,2
I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.,2,2
it's easy to set up and start enjoying Amazon Prime.,2,2
I like the amazon stream with this tablet. Fast and good quality.,2,2
"This is a great tablet to own if you use AMAZON apps for shopping,reading, videos and so forth. May at times be a little slow but other than that no problems",2,2
Purchased this as a gift on Black Friday got a great price. Very happy with the quality.,2,2
Gave my younger twins the Echo an they love telling Alexa what to do. Their older sister is named Alexa.,2,2
"Best thing ever! Since I bought the fire stick, I hardly watch regular TV. We are thinking about cutting off our cable to save money because the fire stick gives us every show/movie we need from regular cable.",2,2
I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.,2,2
My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!,2,2
"This tablet is a nice gift for my granddaughters , they spending a lot of time reading books on this and they have a fun time with the games . Love it",2,2
My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.,2,2
like the individual charger as i do not always have a usb port device with me when i travel,2,2
Excellent tablet. Love the size. Fits perfectly in my purse. I would recommend this tablet.,2,2
"This is our family's 3rd fire tablet, great, affordable solution for our family",2,2
Wonderful products and works for exactly what I need it to work for,2,2
I use to have the original but it didn't light up so it was a deal breaker for me. Now I can read anywhere at anytime!,2,2
I love just asking Alexa to play something. No more turning on the radio and looking for a station to play.,2,2
I mainly use for listening to music and it works great to have between the kitchen and living room. I was already an Amazon Prime member so set up was extremely easy. Family likes to ask Alexa silly questions...it's a little entertaining.,2,2
I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand,0,0
I'm constantly using this to watch movies almost replaced the need for cable.,2,2
Really nice and easy to use.It's my first tablet and I love it.,2,2
The antenna with power booster pulls in more than 30 HD channels. It takes very little room and works very well. Great for supplementing cable on other sets.,2,2
Excellent item I just bay it from Best bay ita very good for the kids,2,2
Works well. No problems with this item. Easy to set up.,2,2
My old kindle finally bit the dust after about 5 years or so. Had to run out to get a new one right away. Was sad that it cost so much now. My old one was about 1/3 the cost. Worth it for how much I use it.,2,0
Works perfectly for my kindle,2,2
"Replaced Uverse with Amazon Fire TV PlayStation Vue, good streaming, easy to use, compact footprint.",2,2
The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.,1,2
"I never thought it would be possible to get rid of my cable television services, but I did.",2,2
This is one of the best streaming boxes I've had. Can easily interface it with kodi and also anything you may have on your kindle fire integrates as well. It's an awesome little box. Would purchase it again in a heartbeat.,2,2
The Fire Tv. Stick and fire Tablet are great for beginners,2,2
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.",2,2
"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it.",2,2
Best Fire tablet for a small price. Works well for my first tablet. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good affordable tablet.,2,2
"i was totally impressed with the tablet great speed great camera the sound was a little low. i loved the price and I will recomend it to my friends. The costumer service was good and staff very friendly , Thank you",2,2
"I got this for my wife and she loves it. She is old school and likes her toggle buttons on the old one. However, she likes being able to read anywhere at anytime. The back light is not over powerful. I was happy to hear this because I wasn't sure if I should have got the one that auto detects ambient light.",2,2
"Haven't had the Echo very long but so far I love it. News and weather when I get up, music as I take care of cores. Ordered Smart plugs for my lamps. Can't wait to try them out!",2,2
My 3 year old has gone through 2 tablets prior to her kids fire. I love the parental control and easy use. She loves the apps available through Prime! She drops it daily with no damage to the tablet thanks to the protective case! Thanks for making a very durable product with an incredible warranty!,2,2
"Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it.",2,2
"We give these out pre-loaded with course material and they are great. With the amount of stuff that we pre-load, printing would be cost prohibitive.",2,2
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.,2,2
I enjoy getting Anwsers to questions quickly and verbally. No need to sign in. Can listen to music too. Fun device.,2,2
I brought 3 of them. 2 were gifts. We love them. Awesome price.,2,2
Better then my old kindle. More features. I'm able to return my library books where on the old one they would have to expire.,2,2
Bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas as they were always on mine.,2,2
Again after some time I just use it for music like the google one I started out with but was unhappy. I wish it looked better since it's pretty ugly. Also the lights are on the top so unless your standing next to it your not sure it's actually hearing you speak which can be frustrating from across the room needing to repeat your self over and over. It it's better at answering random questions then google.,2,1
"Budget tablet, nice and crisp picture. HD quality product.",2,2
This has been a great tablet specially for children.,2,2
INEXPENSIVE GREAT TABLET/E-READER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,2,2
My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!,2,2
I can't figure out how to use without switching out the hd1 plugs continuously .,1,2
Loveeeeeeeee........................................,2,2
Love my Echo! I am still new to the process and am learning how to use it. Listening to music is a great pleasure! The sound is so rich and enjoyable. I look forward to learning more about it and installing Echo-compatible products in my home.,2,2
"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it.",2,2
My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer,2,2
All I bought this for is to wake up in morning easier. It wakes me during my lightest part of sleep within a 30 minute window . That was what made me get this over fitbit.,2,2
"This is easy to set up, we love the music and looking up info",2,2
The Amazon Fire is an affordable alternative to some other tablets on the market. A great value. I like the fact that it's memory is expandable.,2,2
I love this Echo device. I can order items from amazon very easily and turn lights on and off. I recommend this fun gadget,2,2
I like the product and would tell others about it.,2,2
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no handsyou can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",2,2
"My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best.",2,2
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.,2,2
"It have lots of apps, you don't need cable tv if you own , only data svc",2,2
I like the paperwhite read its smaller then my tablet can go anywhere with me and I enjoy reading books on it,2,2
"I bought this tablet for my soon to be 2 yr old. I wanted to download him some games and a couple apps to help him learn. He doesn't speak right now and uses sign language to communicate. This tablet works great. It's just his size, easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case I bought it from Amazon it's the best thing I've done for him lately. Would highly recommend for any and all ages.",2,2
it is nice item my grandchildren enjoy playing with,2,2
"After experimenting for several months with an Echo Dot, I decided to take the plunge when the Echo showed up online at a deep discount. Like the Dot, setup was easy. Sound quality is awesome. Sometimes it works too good as it listens to everything all the time. Its going to be fun to use just the same.",2,2
"I liked the sound quality coming out of the Echo. I ended up returning this for an Echo Dot. The Dot is 1/3rd of the price and for my townhouse, I don't need a high powered speaker. Alexa is great to use, no matter what Echo device you have.",1,2
Bought for kids like how sturdy they are my son has dropped his twice and it must keeps on going. Also. Added Amazon prime which is a great deal.,2,2
"My grandkids wanted this for obvious reasons and when I saw it go on sale on BB, I jumped at the chance and bought it. The kids love it.",2,2
Bought for grandkids. They love playing the games that game with it.,2,2
"My Amazon Echo did not power back on after we had a loss of power, even though we had it plugged into a surge protector. I am almost a full year out of warranty for my echo and Amazon sent me this power plug for free and almost like magic my Echo came back to life as soon as it was plugged in with this new power adapter. Yay, we have Alexa back in our lives! Hooray!",2,1
This is a great tablet for this price. Display is very nice and you get all the features of Android in this. The camera and speaker are not so great though. Excellent gift for new tablet users.,2,2
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,0,2
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.",2,2
This is a very compact Kindle; great for reading your favorite novels on the go!,2,2
"My daughter love it, she always get busy with it..",2,2
We love it. Great product We heard about it from family,2,2
Fast up to 5 windows open without problemsCamera not very good pics come out blurry,1,2
I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.,2,2
This tablet is able to do everything other tablets do. It has expandable memory and you are able to download apps from the play market.,2,2
It's so easy to use and the price is very affordable.,2,2
I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.,2,2
This is one of my best buys for the year so far. Fire tv is super fast and love that you can hard wire it to the Internet. So much can be done with it aside from watching tv and movies which is a huge plus in itself. Love this thing.,2,2
"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Sling TV.",2,2
I use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it. It has excellent resolution and I have not experienced slowness. Good product.,2,2
Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.,2,2
"Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much.",2,2
You can't buy a lousy no brand for this price. Kid friendly. Don't you cringe when your wife gives her brand new iPhone or iPad to the 2 year old. Download apps and a movie or two from Disney and you can have a long peaceful drive in the car with a happy child. If you've bought movies with digital copies you can download them to this device for free. You need to buy a memory chip to expand memory capacity. Plenty of free apps on amazon as well. We bought several on black Friday and have no regrets..,2,1
"I gave this Amazon charger only four stars, because even though it does a great job of charging my new Paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately.",2,2
"I love this product. I have it on the kitchen counter and use it to save to my grocery list. Then when I go to the store, I just pull the shopping list on the phone app. Other features - I use it to leave messages to other members of the family, help me convert cooking measurements when increasing the number of servings for a recipe, etc. Each day I discover a new feature I can use.",2,2
"Got this for Black Friday and the price was awesome, great for kids, easy to use and battery life is good! Nice charger and screen resolution is great. Great tablet overall",2,2
"Solid piece of equipment, very reliable and streams great, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",2,2
"my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !",2,2
Bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. She loves it. She's been playing on it since she opened it.,2,2
"I researched several streaming devices but because of my experience with Amazon Kindle Fire and the reviews read for the Fire TV I decided to do the Amazon Fire TV. Set up was easy (the hardest part was opening the remote to put the batteries in!). Once everything was hooked up, the instructions and tips video really helped get everything started. The only negative I will say is that this product did not include the HDMI cable (other brands did) but that was explained on the box and by the sales associate. I enjoyed this so much that I ordered the TV Stick for my bedroom TV. (And have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.)",2,2
"I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed.",2,2
"I initially bought an echo because of the Hue light system and Nest Thermostat control that it can give with just your voice. While these things work wonderfully, boy was I surprised when I discovered many of the other things it can do! My wife and I are avid readers, but with two small children, we don't have the time as often anymore. We were surprised to see that alexa could not only play audio books, but could read ANY book from our kindle library! Additionally the sound quality is quite good for the size of the device. My only (minor) complaint is that the bass sound is lacking some at higher volumes. Otherwise, you should most certainly buy one!",2,2
"Turns any tv with hdmi into a smart tv, great apps",2,2
"I gave this tablet to my 6yr old for Christmas, she is enjoying it very much. I was surprised how good the quality was for the price I would definitely recommend it.",2,2
It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.,2,2
"I actually purchased these tablets for some students that attend an after school program at the Salvation Army, but I also have a Kindle Fire as my personal tablet.",2,2
Good good good good had a lot of shows on it and it is good good good,2,2
"My whole family has really enjoyed this, my kids love the music, I love the kitchen timer and being able to will check the weather for the day.I have set up the automated lighting control and I am in the process of converting a lot of our lighting to smart lighting.",2,2
"have heard so much about echo ,I had to try it out. Setting up with my router was a little hard but finally got it and when disconects again it back up on its own, nice to ask about weather or what ever and not have to grab my phone need to get prime music account so can listen to any or all music on there but for now really happy glad I got it,good price too.",2,2
This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!,2,2
I have a Roku as well and this is just as fast and has a comparable picture quality.,2,2
Watching lots of shows without any issues. Easy to setup,2,2
"System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)",2,1
I originally had a firestick and it worked okay. Upgraded to the box and it is much faster and no lag. Definitely buy a keyboard to go with it.,2,2
Alexa is a good friend and she is always ready to listen to me and if I don't know something she does I would recommend,2,2
This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to. The fact that it's blue is a bonus!,2,2
I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.,2,2
"I am highly satisfied with the quality of this product. It has met every expectation for me and I would highly recommend to everyone. Better than holding a heavy book in your hand to read,.",2,2
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.,2,2
This a great add on for non smart (older) televisions with a USB port.,2,2
Very nice. Really enjoy it. Really like the paper appearance of the screen.,2,2
"The Fire Tv is better then the Chrome,Roku and Even the Apple Tv, Yes i said it, Its Better then Apple TV And its Cheaper to! Also KODI ..",2,2
"Lots of cool features, especially enjoy the shopping list feature.",2,2
The echo is a great addition to our house. Love that you can ask her anything. It always answers instant. Wife uses the timer all the time. Plus now she listens to music all the time.,2,2
"It's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. The ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. However, I would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phone/tablet this is the product for you. Just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account.",1,0
"I was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so I needed something that I could check email and writer posts on. Now I mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. With all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. The tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. So if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, I think this is a good bet.",2,2
I needed a good tablet for my niece and my nephew.,2,2
It is as amazing as I expected. Reading with a kindle is just reading a book!,2,2
More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.,2,2
"Will not stay connected to WiFi. When it is connected, device has to be within 6-8 ft. of router. Need this in the kitchen. Don't want to walk 25+ feet to use it. My other wifi devices work everywhere in the house as well as most of yard and garden. So I don't get it. Sick of looking at it - useless.",0,1
It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi,1,2
"Is easy to use, great to look up words you don´t know as you go along.It´s also great that the light isn´t shone up into your eyes, it makes it so that they don´t get easily tired and they don´t hurt.",2,2
"I love reading on the kindle Paperwhite in any light. Dark, Sun. It doesn't matter. Plus you can borrow Kindle Books from the library for FREE!",2,2
Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.,2,2
"I'm really enjoying this little tablet. I wat h Amazon Prime movies on it. I shop, check NFL scores and make dining reservations as well as keep up with news and personal email. It's just great.!",2,2
I think this is a good tablet. I will order more. It loads the games quickly.,2,2
My first experience with a streaming device it has been very easy to learn how to use,2,2
This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.,2,2
"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!",2,2
This is by far the best streaming device I've ever owned!,2,2
"Love the Echo. So convenient and fun. Get answers to lots of questions, listen to music, books, sleeping sounds, etc. Purchased one for BR and LR since they are so far apart and love the quality of the speakers. Even purchased a dot for kitchen for cooking tips, recipes, and timers plus more.",2,2
"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives.",2,2
This was a gift for my 7 year old grandson. He loved it. It's easy for him to use and the parental controls were perfect to keep him away from inappropriate content. Hours of entertainment for traveling. Great for games and movies for some quiet down time.,2,2
"Light weight, easy to use, love the lighted background. I am unable to make it stay on page count it keeps going back to hours left to read. But other then that a great ereader.",2,2
The fire tablet is awesome. I thoroughly enjoy the tablet. Everyone should have this item.,2,2
"This Echo device is so handy. You can also program it to turn lights on and off in the house if you buy the extra accessories for it. You can play music, order take out , ask it questions. It is really endless what you can do with it.",2,2
It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.,2,2
So far we like this. We've not really had a lot of luck with linking to both of our phones. I really like the grocery shopping and to do list features. VERY helpful. I'm sure there is a lot more it will do that we will figure out in time.,2,2
It's like talking to siri but getting an answer. Real easy to set up and much better with amazon prime.,2,2
This item is so great. I love it. I bought 2 of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too.,2,2
"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group.",2,2
she loves it. very good product for the money. would recommend it to friends.,2,2
price is right easy to read books onlots of apps available,2,2
"The Amazon Echo is awesome. It is VERY easy to set up. I mostly play pandora music, but it works with Amazon music and Audible.",2,2
"The Kindle I currently have is pretty nice. I did however have to send my first one back as it stopped working after 17 days. Awesomely though, Best Buy shipped me a new one free of charge even though it was past the 15 day return policy.",2,2
I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.,2,2
Don't expect top of the line performance from this 50 dollar unit but it has really nice picture ok sound and good battery life. Shortcomings would be small memory causing laggy performance at times unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory.,2,2
"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all...",0,2
Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it,2,2
This is my second echo that I've purchased and I love this thing. I use it for my garage when working in it and I can just yell out what I want to listen to. With xm radio integration it is even better.,2,2
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",2,2
At an affordable rate. I am thrilled with the purchase fir my son,2,2
Amazon-Fire was instrumental in providing us a quality HD picture to our TV!,2,2
"everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi",0,2
"Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to ""download the app"" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first. Not as neat as we thought she was going to be.",0,0
I really like the large screen. Excellent graphics,2,2
They run way faster then the sticks but I have both,2,2
My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it,2,2
Amazon does it again with a great product. Pushes 4K seemlessly and am very satisfied with the product,2,2
The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it,2,2
Bought for my wife. She loves it. Reads it in bed and the light adjusts accordingly,2,2
I chose the Alexa with the better speaker and sound since it will be used to listen to mucic. Can browse a multitude of stations and various styles of music.,2,2
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.",0,0
I purchased the ECHO so I wouldn't have to Google as much. It does have limits on certain info. but my grandson enjoys the games and quizzies.,2,2
"This is perfect for my needs. I love reading, and can do it in low light situations now. This Paperwhite replaces one I lost in Europe on my last trip. Can't be without one.",2,2
"Most people buy this for use with Amazon Prime, but that isn't absolutely necessary as there are many other useful apps that are available.",2,2
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !,2,2
Works well for the purpose of reading and a few games.,2,2
Easy set up-great deal for the price! Perfect gift,2,2
Any time any thing just ask...and she's getting smarter everyday,2,2
Fun and easy to use. Must be very specfic when asking questions. Music not as good as music played on Sirius. Has good sound and can hear you speak from across the room. I would buy again and recommend to a friend.,2,2
Greater. Good. Ok. Nice. Ok. Enough. Done. Go get it.,2,2
"I got this tablet to replace my kindle e-reader. I was not disappointed, it's a great tablet to read books and comic books on. Browsing the internet is ok on it, if that is what you want to do also. Basic games work great, but if you want to play extensive 3D games, you might want to get a different tablet, you can't expect a $50 tablet to run any of those. Overall, it's a great tablet for what I wanted it for.",2,2
This replaced my 5 year old keyboard unit which died after hitting the floor. I expect this will be every bit as good. Kindle is my favorite reader.,2,2
The tablet is good for the price is really being sold,2,2
Great little tablet perfect for reading books and listen music,2,2
Easy to use and has many options. Like how it can be utilized on two different units.,2,2
Was tired of getting ripped off by Greenlight cable so decided to do something about it.No monthly charge or late fees for movies.,1,1
"Love the Echo!! Wonderful speaker... Great news briefs feature. Adding the music unlimited plan really adds quite a bit to this product. Its even great to listen to any radio station that is based virtually anywhere. AM stations never sounded better! :-) Hooking it up to the Nest and Phillips Hue lights increases functionality. We just bought the remote for the bedroom, which is proving very useful as well!",2,2
I use one of these in every room of my house with a TV. No more cable bills and I get to watch what I want when I want.,2,2
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing.",2,2
Bought for my 8 yr old. They absolutely love it. Clear display and durable,2,2
I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.,2,2
Great bang for your buck. Can also be used for all ages.,2,2
My Alexa is the best buy I bought for Christmas . I purchased the Alexa and the Echo.,2,2
"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need.",0,0
"Trs heureux que les livres soient sur Icloud. Aprs m'tre fait voler, c'est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous mes livres avec toutes les notes que j'avais prises.",2,2
its great for children not costly good for daily use,2,2
I love it my baby really enjoy it she love it I want to order more,2,2
"Got these on Black Friday for $35 each, can't NOT pick them up at that price. Perfect for Youtube, Netflix and most mobile games.",2,2
I love my Amazon Fire tablet. It's easy to use and just the right size to travel with !,2,2
Great gift for mom. She loves to read and now can continue to do so in more places,2,2
Bought 2 of these and love them! First 1 was for me. 2nd one was for my daughter. Very slick interface and allows for super fast streaming. Easy to setup and easy to use. Probably will buy the gaming controller for both of them next.,2,2
I absolutely love this device. Makes my life so much easier.,2,2
This Echo worls well with my Velop wifi system. I plan to use it with automated home smart appliances. Over all it has worked great so far!!!,2,2
It basically makes any old TV a smart tv. It is also 4K UHD. That is one of the biggest pluses on top of me having Amazon Prime already.,2,2
I was hisitating to buy to initially but after started using stated liking it .i would recommend for the same . Great experience,2,2
Granddaughters really enjoy their gifts. It was reported the house is quite because of increased reading and game playing. Taking trips in the car is quite and pleasant.,2,2
We have enjoyed this product especially during the holidays.,2,2
"The Echo can help in so many ways. We use it for music,shopping list and kitchen timer just to name a few of the many things we use it for.",2,2
The amazon fire i bought for christmas works great.,2,2
"For the price , you can't go wrong. More than you'd expect from a tablet at this price",2,2
"I love the ability to pick and choose magazines, books and more at my leisure. Also love being a prime member and getting a free new book each month as well as 1000s of other selections from Kindle Unlimited! LOVE!",2,2
Brought for all 3 of my kids. Love this product. Tablets are easy to operate and have not had any issues with them. Well worth the $40!,2,2
"This is not a top level tablet, but it was not designed to be one. It is nice to have a toss in the car/backpack/etc. one that performs reasonably well and you don't have to worry about it",2,2
"Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!",2,0
"Turns on and off fans, lights, water sprinklers, changes thermostat temperature and entertains.",2,2
"Love it! Lightweight, great for outdoor reading, for travel and all around reading.",2,2
I've only had to charge my Kindle one time so far. It works well.,2,2
affordable great for on the go and everyday usages,2,2
"Love this e-reader! Lightweight, easy to read screen even in very bright conditions. Very easy to check out and return library books without ever going to the library. Would recommend this product to anyone",2,2
I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price,2,2
Wonderful product-couldn't do without it-thoroughly enjoy It-if you are a PRIME member you get to watch TV shows and movies through prime free.,2,2
Only got four stars because it's got to many preloaded apps I can not hide and I got this tab for my seven year old for Christmas. She loves it though and it works great.,2,2
"best streaming device for the money,not very happy with the changes from amazon on blocking some apps.May change to a different device",2,2
A bit complicated the process of loading Books bought in different stores to Amazon. It should be more user friendly for new users (we do not come from amazon),2,2
I love this product. Streams almost everything with no problem at all.,2,2
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!,2,2
"I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes.",2,2
"works great in bright sunlight, used it at the beach",2,2
Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.,2,2
this is great for the price. It is slow on certain application.,1,2
Works better than roku plus apps like psvue were developed with more love. Roku also had some strange problem with working on a tv that requires hdmi to dvi,2,2
"I bought four of these for Christmas gifts. Everyone really seems to enjoy them. I didn't realize that I could put the games I bought on amazon on all of them, bonus!",2,2
"Responds very well and understands you, and this one has great sound as well, unlike the dot.",2,2
"Battery life is excellent. I like the backlight and found the screen easy to read, although it isn't quite as much like paper as some of the other reviews I read make it seem.",2,2
Love the ease of use. Can listen to music and make shopping lists that go directly to my phone. Discovering new uses everyday.,2,2
This fire Tv is a great product and it met my expectations.,2,2
Bought 2 and gave one as a birthday gift. Wow...reaction was fabulous..like...best gift almost ever. I love this new toy.,2,2
It was not too expensive and it is very useful for our Daycare,2,2
"Theses kindle fires ate great for everyone. They are easy to use; have lots of features and are prefect for reading, playing games, getting organized and having fun. My kids use these all the time to do homework on, read books, watch movies and play games. I love that they have decreased the price and are easy for kids to use.",2,2
Easy to hold & read with no strain to eyes. Love that I can highlight text.,2,2
A very good tablet with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.,2,2
My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch,2,2
I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.,1,2
The paper white is a great kindle that easy to handle and use. Bright screen is perfect for sunlight,2,2
it's a bit small but it has a nice amount of space,2,2
"Very nice gadget for Kindle users. The 7"" display is apt for reading",2,2
Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person,2,2
Just right for my mom. Got it and put prime on it for her and Netflix along with some games. I think she likes it.,2,2
It's everything I needed in a reader. The light is perfectly balanced and the text is so easy on the eyes and brain to read. Couldn't be happier.,2,2
"It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!",2,2
It does the job required. It is easy to set up and use.,2,2
Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.,2,2
"This table is small enough for my purse, and handy enough for what i need.",2,2
"Let's be honest, I didn't think I would be really satisfied with a $50 tablet. But I thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional YouTube or Netflix video so I bought it. This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This Kindle Fire is better than the one I paid $200 for a couple of years ago (and comparable performance to my iPad3). It is more responsive and has an expandable microSD slot for more memory. The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!",2,0
well design and perfect size to carry along. What it does is to give you a quick access to e book and provide a better experience compared to view of phones,2,2
I would recommend the echo to anyone who is looking for a smart home device.,2,2
Amazon fire TV was easy to install and the content is great..,2,2
"I've had no problems so far, pretty good tablet for the price.",2,2

its for a gift,2,2
"Never thought I would like this, but my wife gave me one for Christmas, and I love it. It is very easy to use and fun.",2,2
Great Christmas gift for a young adult. She loved it,2,2
"Well worth the investment. Picture quality is on par with Verizon FiOS. Purchased 2 units. One used wirelessly the other via LAN connection. Without a loop, picture quality very similar. Highly recommended.",2,2
Purchased it for the wife she said it's easy to read in any light and she loves it.,2,2
Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.,2,2

This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!,2,2
Have had no problems with the unit. Works as advertised.,2,2
I bought this tablet for my son. It was reasonably priced and he loves it. Easy to carry around. He loves reading books on it,2,2

"I wasn't sure what to expect besides music, and this echo does SO much more! We can check the weather, it tells jokes, and is all around just fun to have!",2,2
"Very convenient and far from costly. It brings sufficient compatibility, and then some. In other words, I'm completely satisfied.",2,2

Small and light enough to put in a handbag to keep with you all the time,2,2
Lost' my original Kindle...This was the replacement!,2,2
The fire stick makes great gifts for family and friends and especially college students.,2,2

"My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works",2,2
amazing good quality great sound incredible range love it,2,2
I bought this for my grandma and she absolutely loves it! Very easy for her to figure things out and she is not tech savvy by any means! She loves reading books and getting on her Facebook so this was perfect for her!,2,2
It's so convenient to ask Alexa anything with out having to get up.,2,2
Upgraded my kindle. I wanted to have the internal light for the screen. The purple kindle cover fits perfectly and ensures for safe transportation. I was able to easily upload all my books from my older kindle to re-read. Now I can enjoy my kindle at night without bothering anyone with the lights on!!,2,2
This tablet is just the right size for travel and the kids.It has the Amazon app store and user interface and lots ofgreat features. Auto uploads pictures and videos to your Amazon cloud.,2,2
It works for what I use it for which is PlayStation vue. My only complaint is that the remote could be better quality.,2,2
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading.",2,2
"The Echo is an amazing gadget. It answers questions faster than I could look up the answer online. It is a great alarm clock. It is fun to ask Echo opinion questions, because it often has a great come back answer. It sings, tells jokes, and has one funny bedtime story. It does all this and I have just started learning all it can do.",2,2
I purchased this gift for a family who didn't have much and I wanted to bless their kids with something nice. This made their day and was exactly what they wanted. I purchased two of them originally but now I might buy two more.,2,2
I bought two kindle fires for my kids and I am thinking about purchasing a third one. I love the micro SD slot and the response of it is great. We have owned them for almost a month now nd is flawless. You can't beat the price anywhere.,2,2
Good tablet for the price! Quality brand and service,2,2
I really like the product. I signed up for Aamazon prime. Now I can listen to lots of great music.,2,2
This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button,2,2
The person I gave it to for Christmas is really enjoying it alot .,2,2
Having some problems with our Echo. Does not hold the internet connection. Other devices on the wifi are fine.,2,0
Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.,2,2
Size is a little small and hard to type because characters are close together. Charge cord is positional so it is difficult to play with it while charging and cord is very short.The price is very good and it works well. I like the Amazon store and added benefit of Amazon coins,2,2
I was skeptical at first but I love love love it!!!,2,2
My 2nd kindle so it meets my expectations better than my very old one.,2,2
Already purchased fire stick but wanted a box with a little more capability. The android boxes were priced over $200. This box is dual wifi band plus has ethernet. Runs great with no issues. Would recommend,2,2
Lots of useful apps and options that give access to anything you could possibly want to watch.,2,2
I haven't found anything I don't like about this! It is just what I was looking for!,2,2
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.,2,2
I enjoy using my kindle. It is lightweight and I can just take it out and read while waiting for the bus or at any time. The Kindle is easy to use and easy on the eyes and it is perfect when reading outdoors.,2,2
Excellent product. I would definitely recommend the Kindle for anyone who likes to read,2,2
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.,2,2
What a deal I got this Black Friday specially for a kid who loves reading,2,2
"Easy to use for any age, would recommend to anyone",2,2
Does a great job allowing me to watch shows i want to watch,2,2
This device is an integral part of having a smart home.,2,2

Safe buy bought on Black Friday for 35 bucks super happy,2,2
I like this thing I have it turning on lights in and out of the house it good for getting info about things it can do math it can hear very good and will play music from my Pandora account that's just a few things it can do.,2,2
"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands.",2,2
"A friend recommended I buy one. He paid $50 for his. When I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $39 I snagged one, I wish I understood the features better. I mostly use it for reading before bed. It's my first time doing so on a Kindle. Was surprised to like it so much! I live in a small trailer. It is great to an electronic library.",2,2
Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading,2,2
"The way Amazon has set up their software is pretty great, they make it easy to get connected to your hulu, hbogo, netflix or whatever streaming service you have. Plus if you are a prime member you are already loaded with streaming content straight from the box, I have two Fire tvs and three firesticks, wouldn't change them for anything.",2,2
Bought this for a 6 year old to use. She still uses it and so far there has been no problems with it. She uses it a lot,2,2
I thinj its a but overpriced. If i knew better would have opted for the flash,2,2
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",2,2
Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.,1,2
"This is a great little tablet for under $50. It's good for surfing websites, social media, watching videos and checking emails. I prefer to use a laptop for more complex tasks. It came with Web Root which was easy to download for virus protection.",2,2
"It is easy to set up, efficient in voice commands and entertaining.",2,2
"I picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy. I have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them. The new product I got was very disappointing, The display had a dead pixel on it when I turned it on. The product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired. I took it back and exchanged for an IPad Mini 4 and am very happy with it.",0,2
"First of all I'm amazed I could buy it from Best Buy, while Amazon says it will be in stock on December 1st (in more than a month from now). Best Buy is indeed the best!The Voyage itself is simply fantastic. The size is right, it's very lightweigh, quite zippy, text is super crisp, and I love the auto-brightness feature.",2,2
Reliable and well-regulated for dual voltage (110-120v and 220-240v) without too much heat generation in Europe/Asia.,2,2
Very pleased.i purchased echo dot but not really happy with speaker. So far very ok,2,2
I absolutely love my Echo! I have Alexa play my favorite must while I'm home. She keeps me informed and helps me remember things that pop into my head as I'm working around the house. I look forward to trying new skills when I discover them. Love this product!,2,2
"It is exactly what I wanted, I can recommend this article to my friends",2,2
I use this everyday. My entire family enjoys using apps.,2,2
"This tablet is great for my son. It's easy for him to access and download apps, play music and enjoy video racing games. Great value for the price!!!",2,2
So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!,2,2
"I purchased the echo just to see what all the talk was about. I found that it works well and really makes life easier. I get my wake up alert, music, and news with ease. My mornings run so smooth and easy.",2,2
"Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet.",2,2
my son loves it he's been on it all day he loves all the apps he can get,2,2
It is very simple to set up on your tv we were going to run a cable to the other tv in the bedroom but it was less money to purchase the fire stick,2,2
"It gets time to get used to it and sometimes it misunderstands the commands, but overall it is really awesome and a great experience!!",2,2
Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for,2,2
We have bought many kindle before and they always work put great for us and the kids can use them easily. I love that I can set the kids profile so they can't make purchases I just wish you could set them to stay in the child's profile until an adult takes it out.,2,2
"Don't bother wasting the extra money on the official Amazon Kids Fire Tablet, we got this with a nice case and 32 GB SD card (both of those from Amazon) for cheaper than the bundle price from Amazon directly.",2,2
I got this to complete my home automation. and I use it to listen to radio and music. wish it is a bit cheaper.,2,2
"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product.",1,2
"This is a great entry-level tablet for the casual user looking for simple web browsing, email access, and low resolution media such as ebooks, streaming movies, and games. The hardware feels sturdy in your hand and the display boasts a scratch resistant surface as opposed to less durable products found in this price range. It isn't lightening fast but loads and runs most apps quickly and smoothly.",2,2
"This is by far one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I'm enjoying all the different forms of music available by just asking ""Alexa"".",2,2
Fantastic option for those fed up expensive unnecessary cable and satellite services.,2,2
A great gift for a 65 year old aunt! She uses it everyday!,2,2
This sub charger gives a quicker charge for our kindles than the other Amazon and apple chargers that we have.,2,2
It's neat to use. Something I never thought I'd have. At the price I couldn't pass it up.,2,2
"This is clearly taking advantaged of Kindle customers who lack a technical understanding of what it is. Go to Amazon and search: AC USB Chargers, many listings starting at two for 7.99.",0,2
My echo is outstanding plays my music with clear sounds in it hears my voice five feet away,2,2
This is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hours!,2,2
My wife has a regular tablet but screen is not good for outside reading at the beach or pool. Got her theKindle Paperwhite and she is thrilled. Great purchase!,2,2
"Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version.",2,2
"Quick and easy setup impressed me. I bought this as a gift for my mom. Within 3 minutes she had the device registered, connected to her WiFi and downloading her Amazon book collection. Seeing the device made me want one for myself!",2,2
Love the reading on my kindle. The camera is great.,2,2
Great product. Would be nice to have the Xfinity go app and vudu.,2,2
just getting this kindle figured out. so far I like what I see.,2,2
Got this tablet during the Holidays while on sale. Take it to work not so worried about it being stolen. And screen is tuff as heck.,2,2
Great low priced tablet. Got it on sale and it does exactly what I need it too.,2,2
This tablet is a good started tablet for children.,2,2
"Nice size to work with, not too big or too small to carry with you",2,2
"I have been thinking about getting an Echo for my family room. I am glad I did. We listen to music, the news, etc. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you will get even more out of it. I love it when my Grandson comes over. I play lullabies to put him to sleep. I can't wait to try some of the other features!",2,2
"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying.",2,0
Have been using this kindle paperwhite and it's a lot lot better from reading in tablets. Not eye stressing and really very handy. Nice product!,2,2
Fire tv is great no problems at all the best purchase I've made this year,2,2
"I had two of these in less than a year, it's definitely good for the price. The problem is that the charger port breaks very often. No matter how gentle toy are, it deteriorates within a couple months.",1,2
It is perfect for everything I need to be able to do on the go.,2,2
"I bought the Echo and a few Hue light bulbs when the radio that I use to listen to NPR new in the morning died on me. I've been very happy. I didn't even have to set it up to find my radio station! I just said, ""Alexa, listen to 88.9 FM,"" and she did it. Just like that. My kids ask her to check their math problems for their homework. We use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The lighting set up was super easy. Alexa is a nice addition to our family.",2,2
"Excellent product. Can get some apps that the fire stick and Roku 3 can not. Of course this is a small screen but offers more flexibility than just streaming. Its a computer, kindle and mobile device all in one.",2,2
"I bought this product at Best Buy instead of online, as I wanted to get in the day I wanted it. Just the voice activated programing is worth it alone, and the quality of the sound. I was using my phone for music, and it was not the best quality and the battery would run out.This is a great product as it solves both of those issues and more!",2,2
We got two of these tablets for my twins for Christmas and they are great. Using the parental controls plus the durability you cant beat the price. Also there have been not one issue with the tablet. Great inexpensive tablet for kids or anyone.,2,2
Bought this for my Dad in a senior living facility. He loves it and uses it daily to answer questions and listen to music.,2,2
We use our Echo daily from researching items to playing our favorite music. It has become very handy in our household.,2,2
I brought the fire tv to get rid of cable. I'm able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows.,2,2
I originally purchased the Google Home as a gift for my husband. He quickly was frustrated with Google Home as it didn't respond to what he was as asking. The Echo is much better equipped to answer questions and follow commands than its competitors.,2,2
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done.",2,2
Like the fire but disappointed that they were selling a device that is a model that is two years old.,2,2
If you want a virtual assistant Echo is the way to go. Amazon was very smart and making it so you can add on additional pieces for a very low cost. Pairs great with Amazon Prime account.,2,2
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.,2,2
My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.,2,2
"I'm still learning. So far we are enjoying music, setting timers, and setting appointment reminders. Will soon be making my grocery list and watching movies. I really need to read up on all she can do.",2,2
Well done Amazon - easy to set up and use - well made product.,2,2
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.,2,2
when you turn on fire box it opens/runs movies fast.,2,2
"Without the lights, thermostat or alarm that you would attach to the echo doesn't seem like a practical thing. If you plan on having the other items to connect then it would probably be a better device for you. Again, solid device I just don't have use for it daily.",1,0
Really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price. At only 49 dollars it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing videos are sharp and clear. Most of the apps I need to use are available and free. It seems to run similar to Android tablets which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates. This might be for kids to use but it fits with what I need to use.,2,2
"I decided to get a Kindle because I was having issues reading on my backlit tablet. The screen lighting on the paper white doesn't have this issue. I also like the lack of distractions, I don't have e-mails or texts popping up while I'm trying to read.",2,2
I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.,0,0
Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it,0,0
"This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime.",2,2
Love to use it everyday. Inside light is useful at night,2,2
Just as advertised. Stunning bright white HD font. It's easier to read than an actual book. My eyes do not get fatigued.,2,2
"For the cost, this is a best buy, if you are tech savvy there are multiple things to come from these tablets. Android is available just have to know how to get it.",2,2
I would say this tablet is a killer deal for the price. I bought it for my 2 year old who loves to watch Mickey Mouse and just random baby songs. Works perfect. Best thing about it is....... If they break it... it wont cost you much to replace it. I bought 2 of them just incase.,2,2
"My girlfriend and I have essentially become cord cutters so we had to find a box top set so that we could watch our Netflix, Directtv, and HBO. We got this because it was recommended by a friend. The user interface is simple and it works great if you have Amazon Prime. The main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep, which i recommend you do, is that the apps stall and don't start up right away. I'm not sure if it's the apps or the Fire TV itself. Its bothersome at times but it's nothing that we have to get replaced.",2,2
"Bought this kindle for my grandson as a birthday present, he is excited about it. Could not believe the price.",2,2
"Happy with purchase, would recommend to other people",2,2
Good inexpensive tablet. I use it to control my E series vizio and andriod box. Apps open slower than on my Galaxy S7 edge but other than that everyting works as expected. Note that google play store is not available without modification,1,2
This product is much better than the fire stick I wish it came with a HDMI cable though,2,2
I am very happy with my fire tv. It's makes me want to buy another to go in my son's room.,2,2
Nice to just check emailAnd read books. I would recomend,2,2
"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, works good. Only downfall is no Google play only amazon apps.",2,2
This product's reaction time between apps is what sold me. No lag like other devices. 4k streaming looks awesome!!,2,2
Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .,1,2
It's a pretty good device but still has some issues with voice recognition,1,2
"I bought two of these for my kids, They've destroyed ipads and this was a low cost replacement. Great price still not an ipad substitute",1,2
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it and stays on it.,2,2
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!,2,2
"My Nephew wanted a tablet for Christmas so I decided to try him with this one since he's only 10, he loves it. This is really a great gift for someone.",2,2
My son had the same Model kindle but a year later his kindle had issues. This kindle has a micro sd slot for storage. I haven't tested it out yet. I plan on testing it out to see if I can load movies on the micro sd,2,0
This Amazon Echo complements the other home automation products I currently have. It works great with my Wemo lights and my Nest thermostats. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to automate their home.,2,2
The weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling,2,2
"This is the best tablet ever! Great price and quality! I definitely recommend everyone to get this tablet if you travel a lot or just for use casually around the house. At 49.99 price point, you can't beat that!",2,2
Didn't think it is well made the product ask for too many sign up,0,2
Bought this to use in my business. Economically priced and a whole lot cheaper than an iPad and does the same thing.,2,2
i was not expecting how great this product is. It was really easy to use and install.,2,2
Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access,2,2
The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?,2,2
"I purchased a Kindle for my 8 year old son and he loves it!. As long as the wi-fi is working properly, he is able to stream videos perfectly. There is also an option through Amazon that allows the user to download videos to play later. Downloading and playing games is very easy unlike a ""child"" tablet I purchased for him previously. The only negative I would give the Kindle is it may not always have the games/apps that ITunes and Google have but I have not heard any complaints for him! Well worth the money!",2,2
Does everything I need in a box tie it in with Amazon prime and its all you need,2,2
got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol,2,2
The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.,2,2
"I have two echo dots and two other echoes and I love them! It's convenient, looks great and sounds great. Got my last two echoes for a great price!",2,2
"Love this,got it jail broken so I can watch anything I want",2,2
My kids love their new tablet Easy to use for them and myself,2,2
This is a nice tablet for its price and size. Thanks!,2,2
"I'm really enjoying my Echo. There are so many things it can do. You can create a shopping list, ask for the weather, play music, just to name a few. The sound quality is pretty good also.",2,2
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders,2,2
"I recently decided to be a cord cutter and not have cable anymore, just internet. I currently have a Samsung 60"" Smart 4K UHD and the Samsung 4K Blu-Ray player and a PC that I use to access all my online content.I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV and discovered that I already have access to just about everything the Amazon Fire TV has through mny TV, Blu-ray player and PC.This is a great device but for me it was just redundant.",2,1
"I like how easy it is to do what i need on this tablet, like downloading apps,playing games, streaming on netflix and taking pictures.",2,2
I bought it to help with cutting the cord. I use it mostly to access PlayStation vue service and it works great. If i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime content. The fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and loads faster than the fire stick which is wifi only.,2,2
I have only used it one time to download an e-book. It works exactly as it was supposed to work. Just wish it came with the kindle rather than having to purchase seperately.,2,2
"My kids already broke two of my tablets. So, I want one specifically for my kids. This Amazon Fire 7 fits my needs. I'm happy with my purchase.",2,2
"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .",2,2
"I use it mainly for streaming music and it is easy to connect to Pandora, iHeart, and my music library. I would like it to connect to my garage door opener and stream to other speakers in the house.",2,2
"It was very simple to open, put together, install and begin watching my favorite shows. I highly recommend this box.",2,2
This is a great tablet for the beginner. Very light weight and easy to use.,2,2
"Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use.",2,2
Having a good time learning all of Alexa functions.,2,2
"It's a great speaker for the kids and the whole family, I love it especially the games it plays on family night",2,2
"I am pleased with unit, I was surprised that it does not pair with external speakers, but other than that, good product.",2,2
"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other.",2,2
Absolutely love my new Kindle Voyager. Lightweight and compact size makes it easier to carry with me everywhere I go. Wish I had bought one sooner.,2,2
"This is an excellent tablet to have if you aren't looking to spend too much. Doesn't have tons of features, however, it has the main basics: music, web browsing, email, video/movies, gaming, and reading. Plus, if your an Amazon Prime member, you can get great games for free like Real Racing 3, and DuckTales. Also, great as a young child's tablet.",2,2
We like this tablet and the fact it is easy on the eyes for reading.,2,2
EXCELLENT PRODUCT IT SAVES YOU MONEY ON WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS AND SPORTS AND MOVIES .,2,0
Purchased 6 of these tables for Christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. The Amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.,2,2
It works well for my daughter no complaints works well,2,2
This tablet has been great so far. We use it a good bit in the car as well.,2,2
This product not good waste of money I would recommend it,0,2
Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.,2,2
"This a nice little tablet although I only have used it very little. I bought it for a backup, because we all know sooner or later ones going to break down. For the price you can't beat it. Next year I may buy more than one.",2,2
"Serves my needs ,just need for quick Internet surfing,email,ect.",2,2
Is great for beginners I love the parental control on it it works great for my toddler.,2,2
Purchased this at a great price to use as an on the go tablet. Works great and is easy to use.,2,2
"Bought this for a Christmas Gift, the item is great",2,2
Best hands free speaker for a beginner. My daughter loves it.,2,2
Expected it to be a bigger version of the HDX but it was not. The email was bad and so was the calendar.,0,0
Love it... quality is great. Love your interactive it is..,2,2
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices,2,2
I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.,2,2
"We are enjoying Alexa for her flash briefing of the news, music on demand, calendar review, and shopping lists. We have not even begun to touch on what Alexa can do. Can't wait to learn more.",2,2
I have one and like it so much that I purchased one for my son. It can be used for entertainment or to control a smart home.,2,2
The Kindle I purchased is a good and expensive tablet useful for reading and internet. It does have a lot of apps already loaded that I do not plan to use and do not know how to delete. I mainly use the Kindle Fire for Facebook and occasionally get on the internet.,0,2
After using the Amazon Fire Stick for about 6 months I decided to upgrade to the Fire TV and it is so much faster and I can hardwire it directly into my network unlike the fire stick which is only wireless.,2,2
Kindle is nice for road trips to watch movies. Good battery life. It's cool.,1,2
"Purchased for my god son and he loves it! Wish I could have found a cover for it at BB as well, but was able to eventually get one.",2,2
"So, I won't be able to go into super depth for this. I only needed a device to run one app. For my purposes, it literally has one job.I can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that I would have ever guessed. And the screen clarity is great. Good battery life.I was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. I don't have the package, and I don't recall it being forward with this fact. In the settings, I said I had to pay $15 to disable ads because ""in exchange for the subsidized price, they can do ads"" or something like that.I kinda get that, and for most people this may not be a big deal. But for my reasons, this is a bit unprofessional to have. So when buying it, whatever the price, you may have to shell out $15 more.Still, all said and done, good price for simple needs.",2,0
"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",2,2
Bought this to activate playstation vue and have had good luck with it so far.,2,2
The screen resolution isn't the best but it's great for the price. Does everything you need from a tablet. Some components like cameras aren't great but all in all its one darn good tablet,2,2
"If you have an Amazon Prime membership, so that you are getting all of the videos and music, then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go. It;s not the highest end, but works great with the Amazon features for a great price",2,2
I love the fact that I can expand the memory. The image is much better and faster than the stick,2,2
This tablet is better than you think you'd get for the price. Decent design and it's faster than most tablets in this price range. Not a fan of Amazon's Fire OS and wish it had Android but most of the apps are available so it's not a major issue. Overall great buy!,2,2
This echo is an addition to others we have in home. We are currently trying to get one out in every room. The sound quality is right there with any nose system,2,2
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,2,2
"The Echo is ok, it's a decent speaker and I like that it has a Bluetooth so I can listen to music off my phone.But there is more that I don't like then I like.For example, to play music off spottily you must have a perineum account ($10 a month).I heart radio will play only the last station it had on, not sure yet but can't change station with just voice.Most of ""skills"" are done poorly, for example my Honeywell thermostat, you can't ask it to tell you the temp, turn on, turn off.Only thing that can be done, is to ask it to raise or drop the temperature.At this time it will not control my wifi sprinkler system ""orbit Bhyve"".You don't always get an answer to questions as it uses Bing as a search engine, which I'm not a big fan of .Tried to buy wifi light switches so I can have it controlling that, but after purchasing the Wemo switch I found out that all the switches in my house are 2 way switches, so that did not work.So basically it's just ok, and maybe in few years it will be better, but over all like I said there is more that I don't like about it.",1,2
Alexa does a great job playing music and adding items to my shopping list. I have not used very many of the skills but I think this item has great potential to continue to improve.,2,2
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.,2,2
"It is fun to talk to Alexa from time to time. Once you teach her some skills, she can do a wide variety of things. We love playing music with her and making lists for groceries.",2,2
Bought the tablet for my young nephews and they love it. This tablet is user friendly.,2,2
I looked all over for a tablet and Best Buy had only two left so I knew it was meant to be.,2,2
The tablets are cheap and can do alot I've bought many cheap tablets before that weren't good,2,2
"alexa is everything we expected it to be, use it daily",2,2
I purchased this to have a smaller footprint tablet. Could use more popular apps but still great for keeping the library at the tip of the fingers and a camera to boot.,2,2
Bought this for a relative at christmas...I was hooked...plays any song I can think of..does math..reads Bible...orders pizza..and turns on lights..I have it connected to my nest thermostat..great gadget that works for you,2,2
"Thr fire is a great gadget for almost any occasion or circumstance, gathering info. or just relaxing.",2,2
I was looking for an easy and functional tablet for my parents for Christmas. They are learning how to use it.,2,2
Love it my kids love it nice to travel with nice pictures,2,2
"This is a great tablet for my 5 year old boy. It was inexpensive at $35 on black Friday. I particuly prefer it because, with my Amazon prime account, I can download videos to it. Amazon only let's Amazon products download videos. It was great when we traveled at Christmas. No more dvds and player needed!",2,2
I really like this product. Works just as advertised.,2,2
"You can't go wrong with Alexa, easy to use. I get my flash briefing news with the focus on the Economy as a breeze when I get home after work.No need to turn the TV or a radio for the upcoming Weather, just ask Alexa.",2,2
I definitely recommend the fire tv vs the fire stick,2,2
This product is awesome. The echo plays songs and answer questions. I can't wait to add the thermostat and light control modules.,2,2
What a super product. So very convenient being able to ask questions or give commands rather than firing up the computer and typing.,2,2
Easy to set up. Sound is clear and works well in a medium size room.,2,2
Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.,2,2
I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.,2,2
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets.",2,0
Bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. I wish there were more silicone cases available for it and I absolutely can't stand the ads Amazon puts on these Fire tablets.,2,2
We check local weather aND enjoy music. We get answears to questions.,2,2
"If you want a dedicated device for reading books, the Kindle paperwhite is great. Battery lasts for weeks without a charge, screen is easy on the eyes,links to dictionary.com and wikipedia are so helpful!",2,2
"Great quality and easy to use! Can't beat the price either. We bought two of these and a little over a month ago and they operate very smoothly. We use them for streaming shows, movies, playing games and surfing the net. I have nothing negative to say about this product.",2,2
"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended.",2,2
Bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didn't purchase the accidental coverage last time. He is only 8 but loves to play games on it. Since it's linked to my amazon account I can see what games he is downloading and control the purchases made. Definitely a must have for long car rides!,2,2
Far surpasses my expectations. Would definitely recommend it as a beginner tablet.,2,2
"The Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great tablet for the money (Got it during Black Friday for $35, but even at $50 is still a good deal). You can get most apps on the Amazon Underground store for free, and most add-ons for the apps are even free, compared to .99 cents each for apple devices. Only drawback for my preference, is that there isn't a facetime app to videochat with other Apple device users with. Other than that, pretty much any other iOS app is available for the Amazon Fire. Videos play very well, not HD quality, but not bad either. This is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet, check emails, facebook, etc, and for the price, it can't be matched by any other tablet on the market.",2,2
Lady had been looking for one of these since Xmas and found one. And loves it,2,2
laods up quic k i love the voice remote...awesome product,2,2
Bought this for my mother who has not used a tablet often and already she loves it and it helps to occupy her time since she has retired.,2,2
My wife left her Kindle on the plane. We made a quick stop to Best Buy to purchase her another Kindle. She can't live without it!,2,2
Very pleased with options to watch. Saves big on cable bills,2,2
We love the amazon fire tv the 4K definition is great easy to use,2,2
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.,2,2
Highly recommended to all. Battery is good. A lot of things to do just like any expensive tablet on a cheaper price.,2,2
This product was a good price. It lets me read the books I want as well as access the internet. Overall a good purchase.,2,2
"Small, compact and perfect for travel. Able to be read while the sun is shining directly on it.",2,2
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!,2,2
Love it. Its fast..the visual is great. It has plenty of room to download games and books on it. I love the mayday feature on it because its helped is when we got stuck. My 3 year old can use it very easily as can my elderly parent. The processor is fast and that makes doing anything on it,2,2
Works like a charm and am Bert pleased with my purchase,2,2
Would recommend it 100%. EASY TO USE GREAT FOR KIDS,2,2
Great buying experience. Bought online. Shipped and received sooner than expected. I wil Buy from Best Buy again!,2,2
"I purchased this tablet for my mom for Christmas,and she loves it.She really enjoyed using the Alexa feature.Though I did have to return the first tablet due to some software issues,I had a great customer service experience.There took care of the problem right away,and exchange for a new one. Haven't had any issues with the new replacement tablet.My mom couldn't be happier.The tablet was a wonderful price.Thanks Best Buy",2,2
"Love my new paperwhite kindle. Syncs with my older Touch Kindle and if I let one battery run down, can pick up on the other. Love the ability to read my paperwhite in low light areas which could not do with older kindle.",2,2
I use Alexa daily and love it! Would def recomment,2,2
"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money.",2,2
"Easy setup, fast.Had everything ROKU has plus games.",2,2
This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.,2,2
"This is a gift for my daughter. I have been utilizing it. So far, so good.",2,2
It started cutting off and on by itself!!! Its like it had a mind of its own!!!,0,2
Couldn't ask for anything better it's better then apple,2,2
Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.,2,2
Purchased on thanksgiving great price for the tablet.,2,2
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",2,2
Very good access to multiple venues. Cheap and easy to use.,2,2
"Great gifts for grandchildren.. At the per unit price, I'm grandpa of the year.",2,2
I can read all my books great battery life and games,2,2
Lots of great features and voice recognition is great!,2,2
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.,2,2
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 12 year old niece. She loves it. She is consistently checking her facebook and playing games from all the apps. SHe a loves it.,2,2
For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.,2,2
I have bought many of these tablets for family members and had no complaints,2,2
"I bought this for my kids, 5 and 9. I wanted to get them a tablet but still restrict what they could do. This tablet has fantastic parental controls. I opted to include the FreeTime membership and that puts them into a kid-specific app center where they just click and play without the visible hassle of downloading, fees, and ads. It's been very sturdy with the 5 year old. Overall I am extremely satisfied for a kids tablet. Not sure I would buy one for me personally, but great for kids.",2,2
At a price that doesn't require a bank loan or cashing in that retirement annuity.,2,2
"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",1,2
Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!,2,2
I originally bought a regular tablet to read my Ebooks but my tablets battery drained to fast and is kind of cumbersome. On a whim I decided to give the paperwhite a go and I love it. It's glarefree the battery lasts for three weeks and I like being able to highlight a characters name in a novel and get background info on who it is.,2,2
Nice and lightweight; the screen is easy to read. I don't like that half the screen on the menu page is taken up by promos instead of my library.,2,2
We are still learning how to use the Echo device but it has lived up to all our expectations. Easy to setup and use.,2,2
My 2 sons 8 and 10 years old do not want to put them away!!!! A lot of free games. Great price for quality name product.,2,2
The item works great love it. Would recommend this item to coworkers and family.,2,2
Nice gift for the grandson. He will get much use of it! It was nice that it was available in different colors so that he could tell his apart from his sister's.Nice size for traveling with.,2,2
"Nice size. Functions as expected. Use it for reading books, email and a bit of web surfing. Like that you can turn down the screen brightness for night reading. Took off one star because it is tied to the Amazon store for apps and you can't easily edit Google docs & spreadsheets as you can on an Android tablet.",2,2
Got for my 3 year old and she loves it. Very easy to use and a great price.,2,2
I brought it to have an extra table around the house for my daughter and it didn't disappoint,2,2
"My best friend loved this kindle. She loves reading books and she certainly love this Kindle. She can read books anywhere she wants without having to carry her books individually. If you are a book lover, like she is, then you will love this.",2,2
"Got this for my nephew, he had a galaxy and loves the amazon",2,2
It's a must buy for the money you can't beat it at all.,2,2
EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE IS EXEPTIONAL.THE UNITS IN STOCK AND GRATE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE.,2,0
I recommend you good product you can buy it at bestbuy in my favorite shop buy it now,2,2
"Great purchase. Really worth it if you have Netflix, Hulu and stream other things to phase out cable. Easy to use.",2,2
Great addition to any media center. Easy to use and great picture and sound quality!,2,2
Haven't had any issues with it and got it on sale pretty cheap.,2,2
This tablet works wonders great price my grandchildren love it . My granddaughter love downloading books my grandsons enjoy the games.,2,2
The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices.,2,2
"It works perfect with all the android apps, fast and never freezes or anything. No problems at all.",2,2
Extremely easy to use and to purchase. The touch screen works well and the auto on-off is very helpful. Love the ability to just close and system is off and not using battery.,2,2
This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.,1,2
"Great sound quality, amazing microphone. Very cool experience to come home, tell ""Alexa"" to turn on the lights and play music from spotify. Well worth the price.",2,2
"I was one of the original Amazon Echo purchasers, and have loved using it ever since. I bought this one as a ""thank you"" gift for my wonderful brother-in-law, who baby-sat me through two cataract surgeries. He loves it too.",2,2
Great item for a great price. You can't go wrong..,2,2
"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money.",2,2
"This did not fulfil all of my needs, but it is a great starting product",2,2
First rate - high quality!,2,2
Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather,2,2
I own a Kindle Fire and an iPad and I have a hard time reading them on the beach due to the glare. This Kindle Reader is small enough to fit in your purse to take anywhere to read. Love it!,2,2
"This is a great streaming box, and I enjoy the voice search option. However, I wish that the Amazon Fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the options of a movie or tv. show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just Amazon. Of course I can go into each and every app that I have a paid subscription with, but It would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display results across the board.",2,2
"This item is ok,haven't really used it to the full extent need to learn more and figure out what other benefits it has to offer.",1,2
This works really well and is very easy to set up and use.,2,2
"Easy to navigate, love the features! Just wish the price was lower!",2,2
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!,2,2
I came in to purchase a different streaming device and the store associate recommended this one instead. Glad I decided to stop in the store instead of paying more for the other device online.,2,2
"The Fire Tab 7 is one of our favorite Tablets, and you can increase storage by adding an SD card. No reason not to get one unless you don't like saving money.",2,2
"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.",2,2
I am impressed with the quality of the Amazon Fire for the price,2,2
"Despite of being a good idea, it lacks some logic or connectivity.Most of the questions non-related to the Amazon universe don't have an answer. Although if you have a smart home/devices the functionality grows up exponentially.",2,1
"I think this tablet works as well as my $200.00 8in. HD Kindle Fire. At $35.00 it is a steal, it is such a bargain!",2,2
"Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say ""Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list"" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, ""Echo, turn on sofa lamp"" and Voila! the light is on.",2,2
"Great features and for an excellent price. I bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. It allows me to control what features he can use, Apps, books, videos, etc. He used an Android one (my wife's) before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used.",2,2
I paid $99 for this and couldn't be happier. It was super easy to set up.,2,2
"This tablet really help me out, as a great gift for my nephew",2,2
its easy to use and the price was great my son loves it,2,2
Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!,2,2
Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.,2,2
"Lightweight and easy to use or read, the Paperwhite is wonderful! I purchased as a raffle prize for work and plan to get more. I have 2 people that have complimented me on them. They love them! Great item. Would recommend.",2,2
Have been using a tablet and find the Kindle harder to navigate.,1,2
able to access movies and TV--easy to use/easy to set up,2,2
"Easy set-up and fun for the family to use. Use the app to add more skills for Alexa as this will allow much more access to info, personalization and interaction. Have fun!",2,2
"I bought the Fire for my husband to play his games on. He enjoys it, but it's not as fast as he'd like.",2,2
"I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it.",2,1
Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.,1,2
"I bought this tablet for my 6 year old and he loves it,so do i.",2,2
Great device don't much like the mandatory advertising,2,2
"My daughter loves this device. She loves to read and doesn't like kindles because she loves the feel of the book in her hand. But, this product offers her unlimited reading at a very inexpensive cost. And, it travels anywhere, is light, and just fantastic for her.",2,2
Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand,2,2
Works well for the money. Got it from Black Friday deal. User friendly,2,2
"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great",2,2
"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good",2,2
Easy to work and downloads fast. Very good quality.,2,2
Just needed a small tablet for video and surfing. Perfect.,2,2
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it,2,2
Overall good product and got everything I need to stay tune.,2,2
I like this much better than the fire stick. Great for Alexa!,2,2
Love this speaker. The quality is great for the price.,2,2
"Works great. Gives weather report ,sends shopping list. Love it",2,2
I've been a Kindle user since the very first one came out to the market and I always wanted to be able to use touch to communicate with the device. This Kindle allows me to do just that.,2,2
"Otherwise, I have really enjoyed my Kindle Fire and use it all the time. Love being able to read anywhere. Also watch movies on it with good resolution.",2,2
Great product! Easy setup and easy navigation. Recommended,2,2
Very happy with this product. I would recommend for anyone,2,2
It has helped me not need the cable company and their many unnecessary channels,2,2
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.,2,2
"Would highly recommend, great product great price.",2,2
"The Fire is a basic tablet, but it's the best I've seen for $50.",2,2
"Even with decreased vision, I can read this, and at night. The backlight is so helpful. Relatives who use this recommended it. Geek Squad were helpful in teaching me how to use it, since this is my first reader. Fits in my small purse and is so wonderful to have while waiting somewhere.",2,2
Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.,1,2
"Ordered one of these for my son for Christmas. It worked for about 6 months and then wouldn't turn on. Tried several things found on the internet to correct it, nothing worked. Best Buy gave us a deal on a replacement as we were outside of the warranty. A great service from Best Buy.",2,2
We love this Echo. The speaker is very good both volume and sound wise. We can hear the music throughout the house. It was easy to set up and is easy to use. No complaints here!,2,2
"Awesome product! Backlit, shows you page number & easier to turn pages.",2,2
"Nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. Also, the search engine, Silk, is not very good. Switch to Google if you can. Should have just stuck with the Digiland tablet--a lot more bang for the buck.",0,2
Smart and handy time saver and loud I love it voice control is amazing,2,2
"The Kindle Paper White is the perfect gift for anyone. My mom had the original Kindle and it recently broke. When I was looking for a new one for her I looked at other Kindles and e-book readers. I wasn't a fan of the Nook and the Kindle Fire is great, but she wanted something simple just to read so she didn't need the internet connection. After playing with the Paper White in the store I decided it was perfect for her. She is not the best with technology, but after I showed her how to use it once she was able to use it on her own. Great gift for anyone!",2,2
"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!",2,2
Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!,2,2
Great device. Only issue is if your not using it for music then the Dot is a better buy.,2,2
Bought this to upgrade my Echo Dot. Definitely happy with my purchase due to the louder and clearer sound that comes from it. Much better for listening to music than the Dot.,2,2
"The value of this device is amazing, the battery life could use some work tho",2,2
i was deciding between the box or firestick and am glad i chose box. very happy with purchase,2,2
I like it.,2,2
The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.,2,2
This tablet is great for kids snd adults. It holds a lot of memory. U added a lot of games and pictures and still have a lot of space.,2,2
"I use it mostly to listen to music. With amazon prime (or Spotify, if that's your preference) I have almost every song that I'm interested in hearing without having to pay for anything. I haven't had the guts to order anything with it, but I'll work up the nerve eventually when I'm out of diapers or something easy.",2,2
I have really wnjoyed this tablet has not given me any reasons to dislike it.,2,2
Love this! So easy to use and navagate. Lots of options. Not sure how I went this long without it.,2,2
"I love my 7"" Fire Kindle...it's great when I go to appointments I can play some games or just read while I wait...light weight too not lugging around a bigger Reader...",2,2
This was a replacement for a kindle It is a good device.,2,2
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view,2,2
Bought this item cause it was bigger than my phone and I could put all my books on it with a larger screen.,2,2
"Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like.",2,2
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!,2,2
I purchased two tablets as Christmas gifts and the children love them.,2,2
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!,2,2
"Bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so I wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its $50 so its whatever",1,0
Could not download apps I needed to control my tvs,1,1
Trying Apple TV for the first time. I love it! Can't wait to try out all the apps.,2,2
"I've really enjoyed using the Kindle Fire 10 (16gb). It's perfect for watching movies and tv shows. The only problem is the storage. Other than that, I highly recommend it.",2,2
"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player.",2,2
"I bought it for a kid. I asked her about and she said she like it! In add, it is not expensive.",2,2
"I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations.",2,2
Unbelievable quality for a great price. Easy to set up and awesome customer support.,2,2
Excellent product just what I was looking for. works great.,2,2
"It's a great technology device and the voice recognition system works great! I can control my house thermostat and yard sprinkler system from the Echo. Echo can also be setup to control the lighting in the house as well. Echo also provides some entertainment for the kids when they ask her random questions and receive comical answers. I have to say it's really nice to just read my shopping list to Echo and have it on my phone for when I go to the grocery store. I've also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo as my alarm clock and weather station. If it's searchable on the Internet, Echo can usually answer your questions. Even though it still needs some fine tuning it's still a wonderful new piece of technology.",2,2
Works great for my 4 year old son. As for me I'm not that big of a fan because of the apps not that same as android or apply,2,2
"Great gadget. Didn't give it 5 stars because it has no option for a battery, must be plugged in for use. Also, I thought it controlled the TV, but apparently not. Speaker is OK for music if you don't like it loud.",2,2
"The fire TV box is 10x's better than the firestick. It's faster , has more storage, and is less glitchy.",2,2
Bought this as a gift for my niece. Hope she likes it,2,2
The Amazon Echo is a great addition to any home. It is a wealth of information and can be linked to other devices in your home for home automation. The echo even helps my kids with their homework.,2,2
Very good and easy to use and to set up. Use it more than regular tv.,2,2
its an excelent talber for the best price in market,2,2
"Coupled with Wink, this becomes an invaluable tool. I can't comment on audio quality as it's location is not ideal for sound. Voice recognition is the best I have used. Play CNN, Play x, Play y. It works very well. The Smart Home connection is really what I bought Echo for and it is fantastic. Make shopping list and see on your phone. Turn on x light or group of lights. Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well. I recommend Echo if you want a better sound for listening to music, but if you are connecting to your current AV system or are not putting in a location where audio quality is not required, go DOT. Oh and DOTs sound quality is acceptable for communication type audio.",2,2
Well made and profrssional looking. Operating manual clear and complete.,2,2
Having had a Roku as well the interface for the Fire TV far exceeds that of the Roku .,2,2
"Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter.",2,2
"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age.",2,2
No issues works as good as ur internet... No buffering,2,2
"Don't know what I did before I had this. She is a great assistant in the kitchen, and am considering getting a couple of Echo Dot's for other rooms in the house. Very handy if you have other smart items in your home.",2,2
Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!,2,2
This device is very easy to setup and use and has great sound quality!,2,2
"I assumed this item would have a cord with the plug. Never assume. It was the plug only. The cord on my 7"" Kindle is very short so I bought a 4 foot cord also. Now I keep the shorter cord with me so I can charge on the go, the longer cord and new plug are what I use at home. Satisfied",2,2
The Echo was very easy to set up and use. My wife has this set up in our living room and the sound is incredible. We use it for party's and plan to use for Christmas,2,2
I bought this with every intention on reading more. Unfortunately I haven't the time. Still. Happy with functionality and options. Would purchase for a family member,2,2
I bought it for my mother-in- law. I am her favorite now she loves it,2,2
"I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use.",2,2
The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.,2,2
"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)",2,2
I love the Amazon Fire 7! It's very easy to use and I love the fact that you can turn the Blue Shade lighting on and off. It's fabulous for reading before bed.,2,2
"It is faster than amazon fire tv 1st. it was so easy to connect and work! Plus I have the 4k TV and it's a 4k system. You can watch some tvs, movies and some 4k contents for free if you are a amazon prime member, $99 plus tax for a year.",2,2
We love our Amazon Echo and Alexa. We are still new to it and are learning it's capabilities. But so far we absolutely live it. I'm thinking we will enjoy it even more as we take advantage of more features.,2,2
Glad it was half-price. Alexa doesn't know much compared to siri.,1,2
"Great Streaming and very smooth. I haven't had it lagging yet,",2,2
This Firebox allows you to upgrade memory to store content.I love how it has alexa on it.,2,2
I had an older kindle that I still love but it didn't have the backlight. This one is lighter weight and has the backlight making it perfect to carry with me everywhere I go. So delighted that my husband thought to get this as a Christmas present for me to enjoy!,2,2
Easy to use and reasonably priced. I bought it for my wife as a Christmas present.,2,2
This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.,2,2
"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed.",2,2
Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering,2,2
"For the $$, not sure it can be beaten. Its no iPad but its 1/10t the price",2,2
"Works great. Love the size. Loved the price. Use mostly as a reader, but nice to be able to surf the net.",2,2
I like the tech but it goes off off line way to often and it's not that easy to get restarted some times.,2,2
It is really easy to program and use. I am looking forward to connecting it to some of the smart items I have In my home.,2,2
This is a neat little device but really not that good for much. I am sure it will improve in the future but I would recommend waiting it out.,1,2
this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice,2,2
It's works really well and don't have any issues at all,2,2
Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.,2,2
It's fast small cute and great for web. I gave a few as gifts and everyonel over it.,2,2
Loveit . Easy to hook up and even our 4 year old granddaughter uses Alexa.,2,2
Very easy to use! Comfortable and easy to see screen. Lots of books to choose from.,2,2
"Myself and my two kids have these tablets. The do exactly what I need them for, to read and watch streaming shows. They have games for my kids and they are cheap so if they break them I'm not to worried.",2,2
So happy I ordered this at the same time as my kindle!,2,2
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!,2,2
"If you want a tablet to watch movies and use with Prime, this is awesome for the money. Not great to browse with but will get the job done. Can't beat for $35",2,2
"Bought 2 of these as christmas gifts, simple and easy to use.Both are enjoying it for web browsing/recipes. I set them both up prior to gifting them, i know it is an amazon tablet, having to create another account and use a different app store stinks...But worth the value.",2,2
I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.,1,2
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.,2,2
Great tablet for the price. I purchased this as a Xmas gift,2,2
I'm an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days.,2,2
My daughter fell in love with it instantly best ever,2,2
Just what you would expect from Amazon. Holds a charge well and does everything you would expect.,2,2
It wasn't what I thought it was the price was too much for what I got Very disappointed,0,0
I bought it for my nephew and he loves it is just perfect for works better then his hp tablet.,2,2
Perfect e-reader with great screen and backlight. Works great in every condition. Definitely recommend the Kindle Voyage!,2,2
Bought this for my nephew who reads a lot. He likes to download books and play games. Great price for the quality.,2,2
"This product is wonderful and has great sound, but really does all the same functions as the dot. Would only buy this if your looking for a better speaker. Great for the kitchen and or a central location in the house.",2,2
This tablet works just like expected. Great for the games I like to play. It is just the right size to carry in my purse. No problems.,2,2
There is so much content out there that is free and he fire is easy to use to watch it.,2,2
I Love To Read On This New Voyage. I Take it Everywhere With Me.Bought A Cute Book Cover For It Also. I Would Recommend This To Anyone Who Loves To Read & Doesn't Want To Lug Around Heavy Books. x x,2,2
This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box,1,2
I bought this on Black Friday for my 9 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it,2,2
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.",2,2
Really enjoyed this like the hard wire instead of wi-fi great apps very easy to understand,2,2
Fun for a minute but soon realized I could have live without it. I use it to control my Phillip hue Lights and harmony remote which is cool but was a pain to setup.,2,2
Very small tab with a great resolution. Price is also low.,2,2
The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.,0,2
Like that I can use it in so many ways. As a computer or a tablet,2,2
Best thing on the market everybody just pick one of this up,2,2
"Bought it for my mother in a nursing home, and didn't want to take a chance of an expensive tablet getting stolen. The childproof settings are perfect for the situation to prevent random purchases. The buttons for sending email are too small for someone whose eyesight and manual dexterity aren't perfect. It's a bit slow on response time, but for the cheap price, a minor inconvenience in this situation.",2,0
Bought for my students to use in class if they don't have a cell phone so we can play interactive games. Good price so I was able to buy a few.,2,2
Bought the paperwhite as a gift for my son. He wanted it for reading as he did not need all of the other apps found on the other Kindle products. He really likes it.,2,2
He loves his new tablet! For a thirteen year old he loves it and takes it everywhere.,2,2
Mi kids love to do there homework with Alexa and leasing to music,2,2
"Many uses weather, intercom, purchasing, games, and it continues to add functions",2,2
"Works super well, always plays good music and movies",2,2
"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok",2,2
"I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!",2,2
"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.",2,2
"Interfaces with my Arlo system, tp-link system, and others via IFTT.Improving conversational capabilities which is a plus so you don't have to remember specific skills. Looking forward to true artificial intelligence capabilities.",2,2
Good machine and good service. Displays color as it should,2,2
Yes i recommend this item. It's also a good price.,2,2
"The tablet exceeds the price expectations. Great for reading books, ok for browsing. The time warner cable tv app works well with this device.",2,2
Replaced my 10 year old Kindle Reader with this. Nice and light. much faster than my old one too.,2,2
"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi.",0,1
Purchased as a gift to my wife. She loves the tablet. Easy blue tooth attachment to sound bar. Good solid construction. Great for so many uses. Paying bills balancing check book. Writing and reading. Nice compact size. Replace bulky home computer and laptops. So many uses.,2,2
A week after my purchase this item went on sale. I think best buy should refund he difference without me having to drive 45 minutes 1 way to return and repurchase as the store advised when I call them . it's not like you don't have my credit card information.,2,0
eyes feel comfortable reading the paper white after lights out,2,2
"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen.",2,2
"Hands down my favorite purchase lately,if you haven't bought one yet please go get it",2,2
"I had to go through 2 tablets before getting this one, which is the best that I have ever had.",2,2
This product keeps you updated on the latest stuff just with the voice command,2,2
The kids absolutely love this tablet! Grabbed it while it was on clearance and ordered kid proof cases with them also! It's been great for road trips and all!,2,2
I would recommend this tablet to anyone very good tablet,2,2
"If you are looking for something inexpensive for your kids this Christmas, this is the one.Easy to operate, good quality and size for kids and adults.",2,2
It is okay does what it is suppose to amazon is kind of annoying but otherwise good buy,1,0
Love my Amazon Echo- use it everyday! Also like Echo Dot for telling me the weather everyday.,2,2
"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth",2,2
Very good screen for outdoors and nighttime use. Lightweight.,2,2
Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,0,2
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it,2,1
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.,2,1
The Echo with Alexa enabled is an excellent personal entertainment system. She is quite intuitive and always learning. Highly recommended.,2,2
"instead of spending a lot of money on a iPad for my kid, i bought this great alternative option. price is great! works great too!",2,2
It work all my home kit with out flaw! it can hear me from across the room. echo is very smart,2,2
"We bought the tablet for work, but the only app we needed (free) never would download. After many tries and several hours, we gave up and took it back to the store.",0,0
"Why buy an I-pad when you can pay much less for a tablet that will do everything you need it to do, plus you get all the cost benefits of Amazon purchasing. One of the best buys on the market.",2,2
This is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight!,2,2
I have tried them all and this is the most solid one. Better than Roku,2,2
"Bought so I could cut my cable. So far, so good. Easy to use.",2,2
Tryed the stick you wait a long time to receive any movie or show if you get it at all.,2,2
love it. sound quality is really good and it looks and feels amazing,2,2
Easy online purchase. easy use and setup and very useful device to have all around the house,2,2
"This was a gift for my daughter at Christmas. It is a great basic tablet, especially for the price. The only thing I would say that is a con would be the lack of apps available vs Android or iOS.",2,2
"you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10"" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes.",2,2
Great and inexpensive tablet which meets all my needs and expectations.,2,2
Bought to get rid of uverse and installed Playstation Vue. Works great,2,2
The kids wanted to get this for their mom this year. I was somewhat skeptical but went along with it. My wife opened it up and the kids showed her how to use it. She absolutely loves it. She starts her morning off by checking the weather before getting the kids ready for school. She then either plays music or news depending on what her mood is in the morning. She likes the fact that she can just ask for an artist or a type of music and it plays. This time the kids were correct.This is amazingly easy to use. You only need to speak what you want. It answers most questions. You can give it items to put on a shopping list. You can then access those items from the Alexa app on your phone. No more paper lists.,2,2
I belive this tab is one of the best low priced tab on the market. There are a lot of free apps and the screen resolution is supurb I would recomond this tab highly!,2,2
For its size the speaker can still fill a pretty good sized room. We are really impressed with the sound quality. It's really cool how it can answer questions and shop for you. I also have it integrated with my Control4 system.,2,2
"It's a great tablet for every day needs. Great for games, internet access and reading Kindle books.",2,2
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.,2,2
Perfect for my now 5 year old alittle off setting up since use to an iPad but she's doing great with it,2,2
"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos",2,2
Great tablet with a great camera for begginers . Has enough memory to start off with,2,2
Purchased several tablets for the children for gifts. Easy to use hang the kids love them. My only complaint is that the charger could be more durable,2,2
My grandchildren love their tablets.they are easy to use.,2,2
got it to play games or get info when waiting at dr app,1,2
I like my new tablet which I use only for my reading.,2,2
"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.",1,2
Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too,2,2
"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks.",2,2
My previous experience with Amazon stick was awful but after returning that I tried this product and was way better.,2,2
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grand babies.,2,2
"can""t go wrong with this item it"" a great investment the price is right great streaming.",2,2
I love having Alexa! My fave thing is the shopping list. I look through my home and ask Alexa to add items to my list so I never forget anything!,2,2
The system was a breeze to set up and was amazed how easy it was to use. Everything from questions to jokes to music. Next step is to connect it to the house and TV.,2,2
Its a good tablet for being only 40 bucks usually people have to buy an expensive tablet for it be good.,2,2
"Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available.",2,2
Didn't work more that 4 months. Don't waste your money.,0,0
"Good device for anyone to use- simple, basic yet fun.",2,2
"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet.",2,2
This tablet has been easy to use and setup for my daughter.,2,2
This is only a good product if have amazon prime account,2,2
"Takes too many time, even being Prime",2,2
"Love using Alexa for music and syncing her with Hue to run the lights, but don't like how specific you must be with the way you ask her. Sometimes just can't get the answer cause she wants to be asked in a different way.",2,2
"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use.",2,2
"I just love my echo , controls my Hue lights just so easy to use.",2,2
I love my echo. I use it all the time from timer to music. Games are fun grandkids love it also. Great for helping keeping the brain working with some of the games water sound help me fall asleep faster. I got the dot to use in the bed room for water sounds alarm and music. Learn something new all the time with my echo.,2,2
It was just the worst software I've ever seen you could barely play or do anything,0,2
This saved me on my cable bill. Good quality. thanks,2,2
I found this item to be very useful for my daughters learning programs .,2,2
Item arrived as described. No damages and fast shipping.,2,2
Anything I have time to watch I can see on this box. Cuts cable bill in half.,2,2
"I love this thing. It controls my lights (additional components needed). I ask it questions. It gives me traffic and weather...and manages my shopping and to-do lists. I know I'm just only scratching the surface...but so far, I have no complaints.",2,2
We love the features of the Amazon Echo. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new gadget.,2,2
Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease,2,2
Great little assistant for around the house! Love all its little features!,2,2
Amazon hit the mark with this product ! Good voice and sound quality,2,2
Was waited on pretty fast. Shown what I needed and explained the features and warranty. All in all a great experience,2,2
My wife and I are just now getting the chance to explore the capabilities of this device but we are impressed. I really appreciate the emails every so often informing us of new things we can do with it.,2,2
This is a good tablet at a great price. Love it!!!,2,2
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games.",2,2
"I got this to upgrade my wife's original kindle fire. While it is better, the original fire was still getting it done. Actually gave it to my parents who just wanted a basic tablet.Only draw back is the ads, but you can live with it",2,2
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my brother. I already have one and love it so much I wanted him to have one too.,2,2
"Great product, excellent packaging, easy to use. Works my connected home well, however voice control gets some getting used to.",2,2
"I waited a long time to buy a Kindle Paperwhite, because I liked my first cheapo Kindle just fine. But I love, love, love the fact that it's backlit and I can read everywhere! The only thing I don't like, is with my old one, when I went to ""Home"", it listed my books and underlined the one I was reading. When I go to ""Home"" with the paperwhite, the books are showing but I sometimes have no idea which one I am reading because it's just showing the covers. I want a list with underlines!",2,2
"Perfect for checking emails. Small, but not too small to watch my favorite shows/movies!! Would highly recommend!!",2,2
I wanted a simple tablet to be able to download ebooks from my local library and get some more reading done. This definitely fits the bill! It's portable and slim and I can take it anywhere. Would definitely recommend!,2,2
I bough this for my husband and he loves it so much uses it everyday!! Worth ever penny!,2,2
"While I put Sonos throughout my home, I chose Alexa for in my shop. I spend a lot of time with my hands full or dirty, and it's great to play music or interact with Alexa apps and not stop what I am doing.",2,2
This is very easy for my 9-year old to use. It also works well for people of all ages in our family and it was a very good value.,2,2
I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet.,2,2
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.,2,2
"Overall for the price you can't really complain, yes it has directed advertisements on the start screen when you turn it on but again, $50 for a tablet isn't that bad and the ads can be removed by subscribing to Amazon Prime which offers features in itself too.",2,1
Have so much fun with Alexa I am getting my mom one,2,2
This is just what this avid reader needed!! Now I can read everywhere.. even in bright sun light!,2,2
My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.,2,2
This was a Christmas gift. Lots of games and books for children. Easy-to-use. 5 year old is in love with it. Nice size.,2,2
Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet,2,2
Screen is very clear and it is easy to use. Great product for the price.,2,2
"Lots of fun! It plays music, games, weather, and so much more. However, when making a phone call or text message, I hope they develop a way to determine who is able to send you a text message or phone call and make it so that you can call anyone you so choose in United States not just those that have the app or device. I do feel that Google may have a better device because they have more advanced database. Sometimes Alexa does not understand what you were asking and you would think she would be able to know it. But it is fun however if I had to do it over again I would've probably purchased a Google because I can just tell that it will probably be able to do more then just play music.",2,2
This is a wonderful product that can be used by everyone,2,2
"It is convenient, great size and efficient easy to use",2,2
"I have had several Kindles (they don't last super long before breaking) and love reading on them. My only complaint is that they aren't very durable and tend to break after about 2 years of regular use. Being that they aren't super expensive, it's not a huge deal, but bit enough to not earn 5 stars.",2,2
I'm usually not a bookie kind of person. But reads occasionally. With paper white I got more chance and choice to read. So it helped me to improve my reading habit. A very good investment or gift for anyone of any age,2,2
Really Enjoy the sound quality! Like that you can do voice commands from anywhere in the house.,2,2
Accurate info relayed so farEasy to understandEntertaining,2,2
"We are enjoying Amazon Echo, but have had problems trying to set up my husband and my music to play. My husband had to contact Amazon service department to guide him on setting up, but we still struggled in getting music to play from our cell phones and our computers.",2,2
"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere.",2,2
So many different ways to use the fire. I have just begun to learn some of the functions.,2,2
Easy to read on and awesome battery life. Great price.,2,2
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....",2,2
"The new tablet is great  nice upgradesLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web.",2,2
"Good tablet for the price. Nothing flashy and does the job. Play games, search the Internet listen to music and watch movies.",2,2
Got it on sale for 35$ great tablet but pretty heavy and thick. Great for kids,2,2
unbelievable product gets you to really live the future,2,2
The grandkids needed some research help for school. I researched and found that the Amazon tablet was the the best for any age. Best But was the best place to go for the best buy and price....,2,2
Finally decided to upgrade from a Kindle 3 to the 2nd generation Kindle Paperwhite. Still hardly have to charge this thing and the back light is really nice for reading at night and is always the perfect brightness.,2,2
"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this.",2,2
We liked the newest model over the other models. The price was good during the holidays.,2,2
"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this",2,2
Way too expensive,0,2
"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads.",2,2
Good battery life. I don't have any problems connecting to Wi-Fi.,2,2
"Works well! I would highly recommend. Better quality than others I have for phones, etc. so I only use this one now..",2,2
It's good to have this box if you like to watch tv series and programs other than spanish channels.,2,2
Very good tablet for kids. I bought a few and gifted them to kids of my relatives,2,2
"The Amazon fire works great! It's easy to setup, the picture quality is excellent, and the Alexis talk bottom makes searching for stuff easy. We just got rid of our cable, but kept the internet and we've saved over $70 on our bill. Streaming shows on the device is simple, but sometimes the movie or show would get stuck on fast forward. When it does that you have to stop the show then wait two seconds then resume. Other then that little issue, the Fire tv is a great device.",2,2
Once I figure out all the options I will be able to save money on my cable bill! It offers many channels and movies. Plus you are able to sign up for subscription channels as well. The downside is that it is only on one tv or maybe I just haven't read enough yet!,2,2
"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend.",2,2
"I wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured why not, it is really cheap. Well, I believe you get what you pay for. This fire tablet froze on me, when I only had one thing open. I am very disappointed. It also is very slow when you rotate the screen. Ugh! I will be returning it.",0,2
I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!,2,2
Bought four of these for nieces and nephews. Works great been several weeks all four going strong and these kids can break anything really easy.,2,2
"The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content.",2,2
I bought this tablet mainly to use as an ereader. I now find myself checking emails and surfing the web too. Downloading an app is a simple process and there are lots to choose from. I use Overdrive and borrow books from my public library. I gave it a 4 because it seems a bit slow at times.,2,2
I am very please with my Kindle Voyage. The size is perfect and the control lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone.,2,2
Best price I've seen on a tablet that does all what I needed it to do... Just simple things,2,2
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.,2,2
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.,2,2
I don't know how my household ran without my Alexa. She has become a member of our family!,2,2
"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying.",0,2
"Got this for $35 on Black Friday. Has some built in ads on the lock screen and does not include play store. After replacing the system with cyanogen mod 12.1, it's amazing - fast, nice battery, great build quality, glass screen.... Can't ask for more for under $65 or $75 minimum.",2,2
My special needs son is constantly cracking screens even with a protective case. This device is cheaper then replacing a screen. An extra note You Tube app has a different colored icon on this device.,2,2
"The new version has 300ppi, which is the same as the voyage. There is no reason to pay for extra $80 just for the page press.",2,2
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!,2,2
Allowed me to cut my satellite service and save $100 a month. No worrying about commercials or missing shows.,2,2
"Looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet. Most of the ones under $100 were not worth purchasing. I was a little suspect when I saw the $50 Fire but having owned an Amazon tablet before I decided to try it out. I must say I was impressed. Obviously it's a budget tablet so you are not getting a full HD screen or iPad like performance but it's also a 5th of the price. It definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing, Facebook, casual games and media consumption. If your a Prime member it's a great way to stream all of your Amazon Video shows & movies. The build quality is much better then other tablets under $100 and it's a multi-touch screen, not one of the plastic capacitive touch screens. Great tablet for kids, grandparents, people with light needs, or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream Amazon Video.",2,2
"Faster than the stick. Overall it is great. 4 stars due to occasional buffering or errors. My internet speed is fast enough, so it isn't clear if internet or box is issue. I use with PlayStation vue and I am happy with it and cancelling cable!",2,2
Bought for my husbands birthday and am very impressed!,2,2
"Gave this to my 6 year old. Not a big fan of the Amazon app for purchasing and downloading apps, but other then that he has no problems with it.",2,2
"if you know the workarounds of the amazon kindle environment, this tablet is a good choice. cheap, lightweight and the expandable memory are the best features.",2,2
"The vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an Echo Dot. We didn't know what it was until it started talking to us as we must have activated it somehow. After our shock, we found that it played music, told jokes, and was in general, fun to use. So, we we arrived home, we began exploring what the Echo could do. Wow. It is amazing. We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do. However, not everyone likes it. My son-in-law says its creepy to have something listening to you in your home. So, most folks will have to get over that. For the price, it's well worth it to explore the future of technology!",2,2
Very different from my iPad. I'm sure I will get the hang of it.,1,2
"Many of my friends raved about how well the Fite Tv performed and after months of hearing great things about it, I have to say this has been one of the best investments.",2,2
"Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web.",2,2
Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites,2,2
Bought this as a replacement for her Samsung tab 3 that was no longer holding a charge....seemed at first to not like it so much but has grown on her since using for her educational activities and some games from the Amazon app....asked daughter if she liked the fire and she said yeah pretty well,2,2
Great! I would definately buy again! I use this often.,2,2
"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps.",2,2
Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.,2,2
I go to hotels frequently and do not like satellite tv or their limited channel selection. This small device connects easily to the wifi and all flat-screen TVs I have found. Life saver on a 2 week training event.,2,2
"The first of these failed after a week or so with lines in the screen. I took it back to BB and they replaced it with another. I was able to automatically reinstall everything I had on the first with no problem. I love this device. I bought it to download and read books from my library, but it does much more. It notifies me when I receive mail and I switch from a book to it and can read it on the device and then easily switch back. I can also do a lot of research that I normally do on my PC. I highly recommend it.",2,2
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!,2,2
Easy to set up and user friendly. This is my second device we have added to our home.,2,2
This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix,2,2
I bought a FireStick because of the price. After purchasing the FireTv don't think I'll go back. Also if you buy this product sign up for your free Amazon Prime and checkout the movies and tv shows you get in HD and 4k..,2,2
Great product.......................................,2,2
Great speaker and Amazon is adding more functionality all the time,2,2
I purchased the Ecco as an addition to my home automation. Works great. The wife and kids love it.,2,2
Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.,2,2
I was able to grab this tablet for $35 during black friday. I was surprised at how great this little tablet was for that price. I would definitely recommend it if you can grab for that great price.,2,2
This is the second Fire I've owned and have found them to be a good reliable tablet.,2,2
This is a great item. I connected it with no problem. The streaming features are awesome.,2,2
I like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.,2,2
I am very happy with my purchase of the Kindle paper white. I wanted a device for reading at night that would allow me to turn the light off in the room. Works well is lightweight and really a joy to read on. Very limited and dissappointing selection of protective covers at Best Buy had to purchase elsewhere.,2,2
"Absolutely love my Echo, from helping with our shopping list, listening to music, checking the daily weather and news, to just telling the occasional joke. You will find yourself talking to Alexa every day! It's a life changer!",2,2
"This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don't do a lot on a tablet, it's a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now.",2,2
Was bought for a gift for my mother. She loves it and works great,2,2
This is a good purchase for online surfing and checking my mails,2,2
Speed is great. Backlight is great. The screen isn't reflective - great.,2,2
Very easy to setup and use.would recommend this product.,2,2
"easy to read, great product When I use different readers they keep tract of where I am in each.",2,2
I have bought a lot of tablets for my kids and all have broken. This tablet has lasted the longest and is the most kid friendly.,2,2
Great product. This is my 2nd one. My first one was stolen. It is very user friendly.,2,2
The firestick tv is awesome and easy to use its also small,2,2
Best thing for me!! Does everything I want it to !,2,2
Best e reader yet ! The new voyage is much better then the first Paperwhite which was great !,2,2
"Haven't figured it out fully yet, but can do and answer many things.",2,2
Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also,2,2
I love it! Perfect size to carry with me in my purse.,2,2
My 11 year old loves it and does a lot more than just games on it,2,2
"This is one of the best product amazon have on the market now, very fast and reliable.",2,2
"Cutting the Cable TV cord. Mostly very positive, only negatives are lack of fast forwarding on some channels. Cannot get the CW channel but that is available via free app. Over all it rocks.",2,2
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.,2,2
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because I wanted to be able to watch Sony Vue in the bedroom without having to get another Playstation console. We have an Apple TV (newer model), and I like it a lot too, but the Fire TV allows me to watch both Amazon Prime content and the Sony Vue channels, which I can't on my Apple TV. The Amazon Fire TV is very responsive, has great Apps, it is lightweight and doesn't take up much room. In fact, we have it hanging in the back of our TV which is mounted to the wall, and you can't even see it. I highly recommend it.",2,2
"I decided to cut cable and thought this Amazon TV would be a good alternative . It's a great product I really do like it ! It takes a little while to get used to using it ,there's a lot of clicking to get to a show ! However , I am not a prime member so there are a lot of shows that we can't watch !",2,2
I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!,2,2
Hopefully works great this is for my 3t son. Can't beat the price.,2,2
"I had known Amazon was going to release the next Generation a few weeks after I bought this one! OTOH, my wife is happy with it. It just offended my geek side. However, it has Alexa and integrates well with my Philips Hue equipment.",2,2
Gave this to my son for Christmas. He loves it. Speed is good for what he does and battery life seems good enough for him.,2,2
This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.,2,2
"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it",2,2
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.",2,2
"this was the 2nd fire i bought for my daughter after the 1st i purchased at christmas stopped working after only a couple of months, the screen froze up and would not ever reset and couldnt be saved, she does use it everyday so i guess we got our moneys worth of use out of it for the 50 dollar price tag",2,0
Enjoy quick fact checks like who was in this movie or how tall is Lebron James but wouldn't spend the money it costs myself. It was a gift. Maybe I haven't learned enough of the functions yet.,2,2
"The Fire tablet is great for the kids and runs smoothly most of the time. It sometimes freezes when in the kids profile such as when the apps have an ""x"" on them and won't open for an extended amount of time.",2,2
Really nice product surprise about how great and fast it works,2,2
"Bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day. We have the philips hue bulbs which this syncs with which is really nice. Love that you can ask it questions, how's the traffic to work etc.",2,2
I love this device I use it everyday for all tv uses.,2,2
Like the size and ease of use. Holds charge. Easy to download books. Easy to read.,2,2
Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.,2,2
Got one for my kids and they love it! It was super easy to set what apps they could have access to and stream prime shows. Not a huge fan of the Amazon app store compared to my android phone.,2,2
"You get what you pay for, with that being said. For 50 bucks i'ts great. It's not super fast wont play heavy games. But, it will netflix and read books fine. Screen is plastic, not glass like most so it scratches VERY VERY easily.",2,1
Must have if you like to read on a tablet. Easy to carry and read.,2,2
"Because the Amazon Fire 7 is a very inexpensive tablet, you cant really expect much out of it or compare it to an iPad. It is a great budget tablet for very light gaming and watching videos. My primary use for it is for video consumption.",1,2
"I enjoy using this basic but useful tablet. I have a standard smart phone, and I like using this Fire tablet at times to take advantage of the somewhat larger screen to read and review certain items. Photos and graphics appear clearly and with good color on the Fire tablet.",2,2
"We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money.",2,2
Love it. I like being able to read when the lights are off.,2,2
Love my tablet. I'm not used to using amazon but its good now,2,2
For low price it works great for everything that we need to use it for.,2,2
We bought this for my daughter.. She love it too much.. And it's the best tablet for the price..,2,2
Easy to set up. Anyone can use this. Doesn't take a technology wiz to set up and have fun with it. Love the music library.,2,2
It was a great buy at Black Friday easy to use very portable,2,2
This is amazing for helping you keep track of stuff. Also fun to just talk to Alexa.,2,2
"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.",0,2
Described as its written and good price. Very helpful staff.,2,2
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.,2,2
Love my Alexa . Very responsive and technologically advanced product.,2,2
Everything about it is outstanding except the price!,2,2
"Bought it for my son, he was very please with it !!",2,2
bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it,2,2
My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.,2,2
I like all the functions that it offers and then some,2,2
This Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen. Is perfect. Along with it and using Calibre software I can do anything with it. Very impressed.,2,2
This tablet does everything and it's so much cheaper than an iPad. I don't know why people spend so much for an Apple when you get everything here for a fraction of the cost.,2,2
Great tablet for beginners or anyone and a great value,2,2
"This is an easy to use tablet. It was easy to set up and easy for my 6 year old to use. I purchased one of the off brand tablets for my other kid and have had a lot of problems with the charging port. Not with this tablet, worth a little extra money.",2,2
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price,2,2
"I think Alexa is the best...Have to buy the other smart components,but so far so GOOD!",2,2
"We have had a Fire Stick for quite some time that we use for our Playstation Vue subscription. I decided to purchase the Fire TV as a second Playstation Vue device because it has the wired ethernet option, and WiFi isn't a reliably fast enough connection for the streaming services. The Fire TV performs wonderfully, and is much snappier in performance than the Stick even in the menus. Our Apple TV has now been unused for several months.",2,1
"Sound quality excellent, functionality is smooth, App required a day or two for full comprehension. System works beautifully, my sons especially have enjoyed the lighting integration with our LIFX and the Amazon Prime Music requests. Will be expanding the system when ""Dot"" returns.",2,2
"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter..it is perfect, and she loves it.",2,2
Yes this is a fantastic product so many things to do with said product...,2,2
"Box works great for cutting the cord for cable, specs are great .",2,2
"The kindle fire has exceeded my expectations, especially given the $50 price tag. Easy to use for someone like me, who is not tech-savvy. Lots of awesome free apps, and I am finding new ways to play with it every day. Would definitely recommend this device to others.",2,2
"The tablet is good for a 12 year old, i got it for my niece for Christmas and it will do what she wants,which is to play games and read books. Amazon is a little annoying because she had a hard time downloading some of the movies, because it wasn't ""compatible"", which is dumb since its their tablet and their site she was getting them from.",1,2
It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.,2,2
Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account,2,2
Got this as a gift to my mom. She absolutely loved the color and how easy to use.,2,2
I bought this for my 3 and 2year old and it works the same as a free time tablet but for a fraction of the price,2,2
"Tablet easy to use and is great for face book, internet, watching movies, and reading. price was great.",2,2
"Excellent product, amazing resolution, great quality",2,2
I also have a Nook but a ton of glare. I can read my Kindle Paper White anywhere! Love it.,2,2
"This is my first tablet, and I have yet to do much more with it than read news articles and comic books. But I really like its picture quality and intuitive usability. My only complaint is that it doesn't support certain Microsoft and Google applications.",2,2
This it's a great tablet for kids it does a good kid and keep them busy,2,2
Good reader for teenagers. Recommended by a friend.,2,2
Works perfectly. Is quick and fun to use. Music sounds great.,2,2
This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter,2,2
Bought 2 for birthday gifts for grandkids!!! Reasonable priced and they work great!!!,2,2
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.",2,2
This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading.,2,2
Purchased for 2-5 year olds. Works well for them..,2,2
I bought this for my kids to play on. It fills that aspect great but the battery might last two hours of continuous use.,2,2
"After not being extremely keen on choosing ""Alexa"" for my husband's birthday gift I am now a total fan! While he loves the customized music play lists, I use her for just about everything else! Her shopping and to do lists have saved me countless trips (and gas) for what I would normally forget to do while I'm out the first time! (Great for Earth Day conservation)!",2,2
"It took the place of my Nook, so is taking quite a bit of adjusting.",2,2
Was given a Kindle from Best-Buy stock.... it was white but from the package labeling you can't tell the color and return it.Got the BLACK KINDLE... college student son loves it for all the class reading he has to do..... connects to college wifi seamlessly and downloads the syllabus and assigned readings.Easy to carry and read indoors or outdoors.,2,2
"AMAZON ECHO IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT AND ALOT OF FUN,ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY GOOD MORNING TO ALEXA, SHE ALWAYS TELLS A JOKE FOR THE DAY AND THIS ITEM IS ALOT OF FUN AND AMAZING, IT IS GREAT MAKING YOUR MUSIC PLAYLIST UP AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE ALEXA PLAY IT WHEN YOU WANT TO!JUDI",2,0
This is a great Kindle for the price. I can take pics of my flowers and send them to my kids. I can download books and read anywhere. I can play games. I can look things up on the web. It's small enough to take any place I go.,2,2
"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",0,0
The Ehco is awesome. I get my morning weather report daily along with the evening news as well. Plus all my music is just one request from Alexa away. The technology is amazing. Having a ton of fun with it. This item would make a great gift.,2,2
Not many apps I'd use. Not as useful as I'd hoped.,0,1
Cant say enough good things about this product....we also have the fire sticks for other tvs.....This sure does beat paying for cable. It is very easy to set up and use.,2,2
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok.",2,0
This is the little tablet that could!!!The price is a steal and the speed and function deliver. Not a great camera but functional. Not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain!,2,2
I was looking for a bedroom speaker and came across the Amazon Echo on sale. it fits my lifestyle and a great way to get my just bit smarter.,2,2
"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.",2,2
This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.,0,2
GReat an fun product for the whole family. Kid wakes up an asks Alexa the weather to get ready.,2,2
"ask yourself if you want a chromcast for 1/3 the cost of this device or do you want to up to PS4 and pretty much get all the features this has and a gaming platform. Then again, you can tweak this system with after market software which you can't on the other two. If you like amazon, are on a budget and have prime, might as well go deeper into the amazon ecosphere.",2,2
Best product to use if your are a movie watcher.i use mine on weekends when it's time to relax or nothing to do.,2,2
The Amazon Fire Tv has worked great for us! Super easy set up!,2,2
I look forward to coming home to Alexa. She's awesome!,2,2
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?",2,2
Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,2,2
"Easy setup, the speaker sounds great for music!! Alexa is quite responsive LOL and quite intelligent.",2,2
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank,2,2
"I purchase 6 of these tablets for my grandchildren Xmas present. I loved it so much, I will be purchasing one for my self.",2,2
"I bought these for my nieces at Christmas -- I got an 'echo dot' for myself. These are SO cool. I added a wifi lamp switch. I can turn the light on/off, get the weather report, have music played ... all with my VOICE !! crazy cool ...",2,2
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.",2,2
"Use it everyday..never had a problem,perfect for gaming ,internet,email,etc.i use it for everything.priced nice",2,2
"I wanted to buy the Echo for my husband and he loves it. We love to ask questions and play music. In the future, we want to connect our devices that are compatible with Alexa.",2,2
"I got this on Black Friday weekend for $35. It was my 2nd Fire. It can do a lot, but the thing that I like about it the most is that I can take it anywhere. If I lose it or it gets stolen, I am only out $35. The new feature that I like is blue shade. I use my tablet in the evening with no worries that I will have trouble going to sleep.",2,2
I love it because my grandson can use itEasily to play his games,2,2
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization.",2,2
My old kindle died after almost ten years. Upgraded to this new model. I like the upgraded features and it is still easy to use. It's the best on the market if you just need a reader.,2,2
This was a gift to my sister in law and she loves it. Only comes with 8GB of memory but you can upgrade to 128 and she did.,2,2
Alexa is as smart as you program her to be. Nice sound when linked to music sources.,2,2
Worth for the price paid. Love this product so much,2,2
"I bought the fire tv to replace my rented cable box....Ditched traditional cable and am using fire tv with playstation vue app....picture quality is excellent, was paying almost $200/mo with traditional cable, now paying $40/mo for basically the same channels....",2,2
I went from an Amazon Fire stick to this tv and there is literally no lag in response time!,2,2
"Like many others, I decided to cut cable and move to more online based video services. The Amazon Fire TV has easily become a centerpoint of our living room. We stream all of our favorite apps off this device (Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, NBC Live Extra, Playstation Vue, WATCH ESPN, and many more!).Pros: The Amazon Fire TV is portable and much more powerful than its little brother, the Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video.",2,2
"Bought it for my mom, she like to play games in her tablet is it is perfect.",2,2
I enjoy having the tablet when I am travelling. Great size.,2,2
I have two Apple I-Pads that my students and I use in my third grade classroom. I've wanted one for home use but didn't want the expense. This Amazon Fire tablet does just about as much as my school Apple I pads but at less than a quarter of the cost. The amazon fire tablets are smaller but easy to use and amazingly fast loading! wish i had one for each student!,2,2
I love the Echo. Despite the fact it makes me lazy :). It's a great home tool .,2,2
"My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far. Had to buy a case separately because for some reason Best Buy doesn't have any avail in store or even on-line, but the Fire itself is great for light users.",2,2
Great concept and easy for kids to use but it does take a lot of set up in many different areas to work like you want it to. You can't just plug it in and go.,1,2
"On my opinion I bought very-very good toy for the people who loves play with technology of the future.. I'm really enjoy when I demonstrate it to my friends and they are impressed. But unfortunately it is not useful for most of the standard users. As I said in a most cases it's just a ""GOOD TOY""...",1,2
Great sound. Very clear and clean. Bass will shake the room,2,2
Easy set up. Easy to use. Hdmi cord right into the tv or sound system. And you are up and running.,2,2
Bought it for my 14 year old daughter who is autistic. She had no problems figuring out how to work the tablet. She's on it everyday!,2,2
kids mode is awesome...cheap tablet...packed with enough apps,2,2
"Before you conclude it does not have enough, look at what it can do and read the specs.",2,2
This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.,2,2
I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet. Although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well.,1,0
"Great for the grandkids, they know how to manage them better than I do.",2,2
This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.,2,2
Movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.,1,0
"This is a great starter tablet for the price - It is easy to use, expandable and cheap and able to use for surfing and reading and games",2,2
"I was not sure weather Alexa would be a real help and flexible enough to be useful. It is ! Great fun and great info. If it only was able to play my music, Pandora and IHeart Music it would be worth it but it does so much more. Every day we learn how ask the right questions to get the best answers and info. The weather and timer are always helpful. Daily Bible verse is great. Her programmed answers to regular interaction is great. I Highly recommend this product.",2,2
It's a good tablet for the price considering it was only $50. Not the best quality but suitable for my kids to enjoy,1,2
"I own a firestick, so I decided to invest in a Amazon Fire TV box. It streams my movies really well and the picture quality is great. I really love my Fire TV box and I am recommending the Fire TV box to my family and friends. I do not regret this purchase.",2,2
It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!,2,2
I would recommend the Kindle Fire as a great option for anyone who loves to read book after book. Well worth the price. Not so thrilled that a 2 year warranty was half the price of the item I purchased but that has nothing to do with the quality of the device.,2,2
Got this for my mother in law and she loves it. It's easy on your eyes and it is very user friendly.,2,2
"Found I am using the ""Fire""' more then my phone. Speed is fast.. Easy to navigate.",2,2
For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.,2,2
I love this I installed all my videos. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.,2,2
The dot does everything this does and most people already have blue tooth speakers to hook up to it.,1,2
"This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if you’re out and about. I have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it (and it’s free). I am one satisfied customer!",2,2
"This Samsung watch is just what the doctor ordered. I can see who's calling,texting,e-mailing all while watching my health at the same time ! Great product",2,2
This thing is amazing. The voice recognition is awesome and it does an excellent job picking up my voice even when playing music. Its integration into my smart home was flawless and adds a whole new level to my home.,2,2
Perfect upgrade from the original fire stick great quality!,2,2
The echo has be a nice addition to the home. Helps connect other devices and Amazon features. Great speaker quality. Fun to use,2,2
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.",2,2
Loved this tablet before. Happier now with lower price and expandable memory.,2,2
Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.,2,2
"I bought this as a christmas gift.. The person I bought it for had a different brand and had troubles with it, they have been extremely happy with the Fire tablet",2,2
Super and funIs work in my xbox one sMy light insteon,2,2
Granddaughter loves it. She plays on it daily and downloads the games with no problem,2,2
"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself.",2,2
It was a gift for someone so I don't know about it,2,2
Didn't like it. To many pop up ALL THE TIME. Don't recommend at all,0,2
Alexa is a great music ai product. I totally love it! I bought it because many of my friends have it and i personally would recommend it to other friends.,2,2
"The Kindle Paperwhite is reliable, holds a charge for weeks, is lightweight and easy to hold, allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone (because of the backlit surface), and stores hundreds of books. What can I say? I love my Kindle, and this one was the second I have bought...this one as a gift for an elderly parent. She loves it! The font is easy to adjust for people who need large print. I take my Kindle everywhere so I am never bored whether I am waiting in the doctor's office or stuck in an airport overseas..",2,2
Perfect gift for the tech family and introduction to the numerous options now available through wireless connections,2,2
I gave this to my daughter and son N law for Christmas. They seem to really like it and are just starting to get the hang of it and learn more about it. But their initial using of this is all good and they like what it can do..,2,2
Bought this kindle for my 75 yr old mother. She loves it.,2,2
"Great for reading, not great for playing games needs more storage.",1,2
i bought this for someone for a gift for xmas. this is a good simple tablet for someone to being with.,1,2
"It took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. The video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. I love the convenience of having a smaller tablet - my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. That said - in sleep mode it lasts days. Very happy, and will be purchasing a larger Fire tablet in the future.",2,2
the kids love it they learn something every day i'm happy i bought it,2,2
"Alexa answers a lot of questions, plays any song you want, and has great sound!",2,2
It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.,2,2
My 12 year old son bought this. Great for him. Only downfall is his old one broke after only one small drop. Would recommend protection plan.,2,2
"Bought this for my son, he really enjoys using it especially as an e-reader,",2,2
"got this a gift for a friend, she loved it and the things she can do with it.",2,2
Its now a part of our family. Its so much easier to ask for the time in the morning while my eyes are still closed and lights off. Setting the alarm has been a breeze too. Just before we go to sleep me tell Alexa to to sing us some songs and we tell it to stop and its done. I am now looking forward to get the lights connected to this as well.. Love it so far. The only thing is I wish it had a better search features that would search on the web.,2,2
"Simply great. Really comfortable to read, even for hours. Took me a bit to get used to the light settings though, but once I got the hang of it, really nice.",2,2
"Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!",2,2
This was a great price and excellent gift. It has a lot of built in apps that both adults and kids will enjoy.,2,2
Awesome little machine...kids talk to it everyday five times a day!!,2,2
Incredibly awesome device. Signed up with Amazon music and I've been jamming nonstop.,2,2
Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option,2,2
"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",0,2
"The Amazon Echo is a great tool to keep around the house. We keep ours in the family room/kitchen area. Simply ask Alexa a question and she will provide the answer. Also, link up to Pandora or your Amazon music account and she'll play music for you. Good speakers as well..",2,2
We bought a second tv so we needed another firetv box. It works great with the services we're using.,2,2
Bought this for my 7 year old daughter. Great first tablet for a child.,2,2
Product was damaged. Needs lot of improvement on the API's.,0,2
Love it amazing easy to use love the look sound amazing,2,2
Kids are able to play their games and watch movies on road trips.... win!,2,2
Battery life is excellent. Lasts days. No glare when reading outside,2,2
"This is my third Kindle, first two worked out great for my kids so I got another. Great value for money",2,2
Bought this Kindle because I could not read my older one in the sunshine. This fits the bill.,2,2
"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",2,2
"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books.",2,2
"Apps for square, PayPal, and such not available bought thinking best option for business. Not so. Needed inexpensive great. Need certain apps check before buying.",2,2
Product was good for $50. Heavier than I expected. I was looking to replace an older Kindle. Nothing fancy but adequate.,2,2
"Could not download my books at home. Three visits to Best Buy, returned it.",0,2
I was not surprised by anything I found out. The deviae works as advertised. It's great with the simple commands. I hope it interfaces as well as I've read about with Harmony and SmartThings.,2,2
I got two of these for my kids. If they break oh well. Good for a step up from leappad.,2,2
I like the box much better than the stick. It has more memory along with optical out for surround sound etc. Voice activated remote and just overall smoother. Definitely worth the money to upgrade to the box over the stick.,2,2
This a good tablet. How ever I made it better by putting cyanogen mod on this to use the full android operating system,2,2
"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price.",2,2
It allows us to watch movies and stuff that we normally would not get to see.,2,2
This is a great device to have if you dont have cable at home and you need to add a program call Kodi also.,2,2
Had the HD Fire 6 and was disappointed that it did not have an SD slot. This one has the slot and has worked flawlessly. My kids love it. I bought 3 of them.,2,2
Alea echo is hands down the best smart device manager I've ever owned.,2,2
This is my 4th Kindle and I enjoy reading on it. Goes every where with me.,2,2
"I got this tablet for my 7 yr. old daughter, for the price its very good. Its the perfect size for small children.",2,2
I love the Amazon Fire. I am able to play all my movies and shows on my fire. It's great!,2,2
"It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast.",2,2
I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,2,2
"I've had the Fire Stick for awhile, and thought it was just fine, why spend more for the Fire TV? Well now that I have the Fire TV, I'm glad I bought. It is faster than the Stick, and works better in every way. Love the voice command! Get one!",2,2
"Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting Go To Footnotes. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the x at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. Supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. Does not highlight any text.",2,0
"I purchased 2 of these for my kids, (7yrs and 15yrs old) and they love them. They're constantly staying on them. The battery lasts for about 8 hrs and not long to charge. I love the fact they they come pre-charged too. What ever you do, please buy a case for them. I couldn't have brought a better budget tablet.",2,2
"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!",2,2
Lightweight and compact e-reader that is suitable for any age who loves reading on the go.,2,2
"I use this item every day to get subway conditions, news, music, alarms and calendar schedule for the day. I would highly recommend!",2,2
"I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!",2,2
Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.,2,2
I love this for it's music capabilities. Great sound. Easy function,2,2
My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.,2,2
These tablets are so much better in different colors. Well worth it!,2,2
I received this as a gift and loved it so much that I bought one for my husband.,2,2
Awesome for the kids and a great price....does the same as an expensive one,2,2
I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.,0,0
For the price you pay and to do basic functions this table is well worth the money.,2,2
"This is really helpful for everyday use. Helps with entertainment, ect. I really enjoy.. Echo",2,2
Easy to set up and start using. Love having any type of music at the prompt of my voice!,2,2
Its a great worth of the money spent on it. Good for reading,2,2
Great value. I don't have any issues with this tablet. Some others mentioned ebooks were difficult to read but I don't have that problem. The storage is tight so I added a 64GB card to it. I use it every day.,2,2
More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.,2,2
Tablet purchase good and affordable for the price.,2,2
Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.,2,2
The tablet has been great for reading and the picture is large enouph,2,2
"I needed something that's not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it's not iPad, but it's good for a tablet)",2,2
"This amazon fire box works great. I don't have cable, we use the apps and Netflix that is connected to wifi. Easy to set up. We have one in every room.",2,2
"Amazon has been marekting this via emails to me for a while. Didn't think much of it at first until I found out this works well with home automation. I have almost every light in my home ""connected"" using a Smartthings hub. I look so cool to my friends that have never seen an Echo before. With a quick command I can turn on or off any of my connected lights one by one or use an IFTTT command to turn everything on or off. Yes, it works with IFTTT!!! You can get pretty creative with it. Having a multi-level home, I can command Echo/Alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my Ring doorbell :). This is one cool device for lazy people like me LOL. I use it to get the weather, traffic, sports scores (Go Warriors!), and create/add items to my shopping list. It plays music from numerous streaming music services but being a Prime Member and having used everything from Pandora to Spotify I find Prime Music the best for my taste in music. It's also free with my Prime Membership so I don't have to listen to ads or get stuck not being able to skip a song I don't particularly like. I've also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory. I leave the Echo in my dining room/kitchen area and I can send commands to Echo from my bedroom without a glitch. I can't wait for my Echo Dots to arrive. Call me an Echo fanatic but I tell you...it's an awesome piece of technology. And it keeps getting better as Amazon continues to develop and add new features. My only gripe is that I can't control my home security system with it. Simplisafe just doesn't want to play with anyone...boo!",2,2
"nice price, loved the price match--easy to get refund of cost differencemuch simpler to view than original kindle",2,2
"Our Alexa stopped working so Amazon customer service suggested I try purchasing a new adapter. It arrived and fixed the problem. It was a much cheaper, and easier fix than I anticipated. Very happy with this product!",2,2
"bought this for my 2 years old, the tablet is strong, and he loves it, and best part is i was able to download the google play store without rooting.",2,2
"The Kindle Fire was a perfect gift for my wife. She has not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something compact, affordable and very easy to use.",2,2
It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.,2,2
The Fire TV is by far the best of any of the Stream Boxes,2,2
Easy to use. Easy download games. Kids love to do school work on tablets,2,2
Got two of these for my father and mother in laws for Christmas and they absolutely love them. Easy to use and great first tablet.,2,2
This was the best purchase I've made in a while. The text quality it excellent and the back-lighting is a real plus.,2,2
I brought this tablet for myself. Good product especially for what I paid for it. Got it on sale for $33 on Black Friday online. Very happy I didn't have to wait in line at the stores.,2,2
Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution,2,2
Works flawlessly most of the time. Would be 5 stars if amazon would stop fighting against people rooting their devices. It's our streaming box. Let us do what we want with it.,2,2
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",2,2
"Already had one Echo and enjoyed it so much, I couldn't pass up getting another one at almost half price during Best Buy's Amazon deal day.",2,2
The echo was easy to set up and connect to Spotify and the sound quality is good. It's pretty good at basic questions like time and weather but it's natural language understanding isn't as good at understanding and answering more complex questions.,2,2
I got this for a friend an was very pleased. The fire tablet is awesome. It dose everything the kindle fire dose.,2,2
Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.,2,2
Love how I can read in bed without the light on so it does not bother my husband. And it keeps me from cluttering the house with so many books. Also don't have to wait til you make it to the store to buy the next book cause they are all right at your finger tips!,2,2
"If you are looking to add smart TV capabilities to your TV (or replace existing smart TV capabilities), this is the product to own! In my opinion Amazon knocked it out of the park with this streamer. Paired with a 4K TV, it adds amazing clarity to 4K Content!",2,2
Love my kindle! This is my 3rd kindle. I can't live without. I do wish it has audio capability.,2,2
Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.,2,2
"This is my third one, don't use anything else for reading books.",2,2
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV to cut my cable and use it for Play Station Vue. It has worked great. It is super fast compared to the fire stick. I tried the Roku as well but for this application the Fire tv was the clear winner. I liked it so much I bought 3. One for all my Tvs. The Roku didn't have a guide menu and that was a big issue. It also works great with Netflixs. Picture quality is great, probably better than what I was getting with cable. Overall this is going to save me a lot of money and I am not missing any quality or channels.",2,2
Product works as advertised. Setup is easy with Alexa mo Ike app for initial configuration. Speaker is perfect for streaming.,2,2
I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.,1,2
"The firestick with voice remote has tamed the TV again, making watching enjoyable and easy. My wife is the one who is really sold on it, as she had become frustrated with most of the gadgets I've brought into the house. This one she won't part with!",2,2
"Not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with Google Play services, Play Store, etc. Definitely needs to be improved upon",1,2
"Other kindle had a hole in screen from kids...upgraded to the paper white screen, works great",2,2
"Amazon Echo is really useful with everything it already can do. Currently it is needed as a hands-free device and we use it to control lights, to send emergency phone calls, as an alarm, streaming music player, shopping list, weatherman, and to search the internet. When it can completely control a phone's text and calling capabilities, we'll have everything we need from it.",2,2
Great device. Sometimes it's hard for it to pick up voice. Good purchase,2,2
Fast. Plenty of great apps. Nice picture. Lot of fun to use . Highly recommend.,2,2
Too,0,1
It is affordable and a great product. Its a great ereader as well as a great tablet. Just the right size to play games and watch movies on.,2,2
Ease of use and setup 9/10It would be nice if it was out of the box easier to view your own content.,2,2
I purchased two for my nephew and niece. They love it. My little nephew is having lots of fun taking pictures. Great tablet and affordable price.,2,2
"Great entertainment devicegood brand, quality and price!",2,2
Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!,2,2
The speaker is a really great convienence device. However my only gripe is that the speakers' sound warps at high volumes if there's a lot of bass.,2,2
I had purchased the original kindle s few years ago and in December sprang for the new kindle paper white. I thought I might have been wasting money but it is definately an improvement to the original. It's lighter and so much clearer to read from. It's easier to read in dark situations or on flights at night. I love the differences the new improved kindle provides.,2,2
Amazon account dependent speaker with decent sound,1,2
This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.,2,2
"This tablet works well and provides basic app service. It does a great job for what it is intended for,",2,2
Does everything it says it does. Great speaker. Good alarm. Bought 3,2,2
I also own one. They are great easy to. I got my four grand daughters one they love them.,2,2
"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money.",2,2
It's the best choice for $30 to leave home or with friends.,2,2
"I bought 2 of these tablets as gifts for my nephews, ages 7 and 11. They absolutely love them!",2,2
This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.,2,2
The best value for the money hands down. Works perfectly.,2,2
I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.,2,2
"Still exploring the possibilities. I bought it as a ""sort of"" addition to my Kindle e-reader. Since I am not a total subscriber to the ""connected lifestyle"" I will be exploring capabilities slowly. My only complaint is the battery life is not (by a factor of (at least) 50) as good as on my KIndle e-reader.",2,2
Excellent value for the money can not go wrong for the price,2,2
"We have enjoyed Alexa. She will play songs for us, give us information, and even tell jokes.",2,2
"Purchased this as a gift for my husband and didn't know what exactly it was all about. Once we installed it and saw all of the things we can watch on it, I was hooked. Very easy to navigate through all of the apps. Considering dropping our cable provider because most of the shows we watch are available through Fire TV. Highly recommend! We will also be purchasing a couple of Firesticks so we can watch in other rooms.",2,2
I love her...she tells me jokes and tells me the weather and the news...we play games ..she's the bomb,2,2
"I use it for reading at night in my room, the light makes it great.",2,2
Now I can read in the bright sun or in the darkness of the night. Love it!,2,2
Still needs refinement. Works well with some smart home items. But needs to be more consistent. Also follow up questions. Won't just continue with the thought. I feel it's something which may be truly amazing within a year,2,2
We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones,2,2
I am an Apple Fan but I had to see what all the buzz was about with the Amazon FireTV. I decided on the box instead of the stick because it had more memory and could be placed in my cabinet. I mainly wanted to use it with Kodi and it has worked well so far. I also like that it supports 4K streams from Netflix. Setup was very easy and was packaged well similar to the way Apple packages their products.,2,2
Great gift for a son who has everything and loves technology. His children love asking it questions.,2,2
"Decent product. It's definitely not for anyone who wants a tablet to stream or play games (other than amazon prime and laggy games) but it's OK for internet browsing and general use. It's on the lowest end of the tablet prices, so you get what you pay for",1,0
"This is an ok tablet. We bought it thinking it would be good for travels with our little one, but it's not what we expected. Our little one is able to exit out of movies and apps. There is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little ones. This would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who wants a tablet but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.",1,0
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know,2,2
"MY GRANDCHILDREN GOT THEIR TABLETS FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEY LOVE THEM, THEY USE THEM AT SCHOOL AND FOR GAMES AND MOVIES AFTER THEIR HOMEWORK IS DONE, VERY EASY TO USE AN PARENTAL CONTROLS ARE GREAT",2,1
Use it to listen to the amazon prime music all the time!,2,2
I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.,2,2
My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.,2,2
"We ask Alexa questions all day, recently, I received a gift of Amazon Prime, now I have Alexa read my free books while I work around the house! my husband asks weather and ballgame scores.",2,2
This is a great budget tablet that performs like one 3x as much.,2,2
"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine.",0,0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8"" screen. The price was perfect for my budget.",2,2
New fire has a number of changes over my Kindle fire some easier to use others not so. Overall a very good product t.,2,2
"FABULOUS HANDS OFF TECHNOLOGY, A MUST IN A BUSY HOUSEHOLD",2,0
Researching all of the like products I find that this product best ties in with other sevices i use. I would recommend to my friends and family,2,2
Got this as a gift for my husband. He loves it! Easy to setup and is a nice piece of equipment. Awesome.,2,2
I like the amazn tv because it allowes me to watch everyhting using one device,2,2
"Kindle Paperwhite is great for reading any time, day or night (without needing a light!)... and any where, beach, bed, airplanes. So much more convenient, i.e. better, than carrying a book, or several books!",2,2
This is a very responsive device for the amount paid,2,2
Got this item during a sale and absolutely love it. It is a lot of fun and easy to use.,2,2
"I had originally bought the Fire Stick to do live streaming and it worked great, but after awhile I decided to upgrade to a faster media box. After a lot of research reading a ton of reviews I decided to get the Fire TV and I'm glad I did. The Fiire TV is works great with my Amazon Prime account, it's much faster especially connected via Ethernet, the memory is expandable, better picture, better wifi, and with the 2gb ram I'm seeing virtually no buffering with playing 1080p content! The remote is a lot better than the original and the voice commands are an added plus. I would definitely with no hesitation recommend getting this if you are Prime Member and want quality streaming. Cheers!",2,2
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!,2,2
I purchased this for my 9 year old niece and she LOVES it. Very kid friendly.,2,2
We bought it for my son but the whole family uses it. We really enjoy it,2,2
Loved it very good product. Couldn't ask for anything better.,2,2
"Great Bang for your Bucks, thats the first thing that comes to your mind, when you hold the tablet. It feels solid, it works great and doesnt feel cheap at all. I have experience, number of low cost tablets and you feel them the moment you hold them, Agree, you cannot compare to iPad mini or other comparable brand tablets. But at this price point, I am not at all hesitant to gift someone. I cant put my head around, how are they able to offer such great quality at this price, simply amazing!!",2,2
"Amazon Fire tv is the best box, fast, good interface and simple",2,2
No joke I have one on every tv in my house.This unit is so powerful and *customizable.The content of movies and tv shows that you can stream is almost unlimited these days.,2,2
"It was the cheapest tablet, but still very useful considering it was for my toddler. Wanted something that I could play child shows from youtube and some learning games from apps. Wish there were more apps for him, but I'm sure with time Amazon will have a few more I'd like to see just as Apple does. When not in use, from time to time it works great for the needs I may have if I want a bigger screen than my iPhone or don't feel like booting up a laptop. The only downfall is that when it's locked, it displays ads for games. I found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet.",2,2
Enjoy playing jeopardy and asking about weather in other locations,2,2
Easy to set up and lots of fun to use. Gives good info.,2,2
"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her.",2,2
"I got this as a replacement for my daughters kindle. It works much better than the one that came in the box, no idea why but thankful it was sent to me!",2,2
We bought the echo and we really enjoy it. It is great for music and much more,2,2
I love this thing! Awesome for outdoor reading! iPads can't compare. The biggest plus for me is that I'm not bombarded with messages or call and can stay focused on reading.,2,2
"Was not sure of which was better, but went with the Echo. We are quite pleased and use it all the time. Still learning all the ins and outs, but it is very good.",2,2
Own a firestick and didn't like the lag so I bought the fire tv. Problem solved. Super smooth. Fast. Responsive.,2,2
Best FireTV yet. Shows 4k and 1080p content well. Amazon Prime members get extra benefits.,2,2
"Much nicer than the competition, fast wifi or LAN hookup. The menu is fast and easy to work with. The voice search is helpful and works like Google search or Siri.",2,2
For an android powered device and no google support it works alright,2,2
"Better then Apple TV to me. Cause I have an Amazon account. Amazon video, music and all the tv apps. I'm all for this",2,2
I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.,2,2
I am a long time Kindle user. I also have a Kindle Fire 8. I keep buying the newer versions because I like the product very much.,2,2
"Great product, good size for travel. We bought it for our girl, we use it when we travel, and put it on the back seat, so she can see videos or movies",2,2
Only few skills were added to Alexa. And When my kids are asking general educational related it is not giving them right answers.,2,2
You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,2,2
my 6 year old granddaughter loves her new tablet. she uses it to play games and download movies.,2,2
Best bang for your buck for a tablet for a kid to start off with,2,2
"Wife enjoys the camera feature, but hates all the ads. She'd recommend this to a friend IF they were on a budget.",2,2
My kids each got one of these tablets for Christmas. They love it. I like how it has parental controls so I can control what apps are on the tablet.,2,2
"Speaker system for music play is great. Very sensitive to her name ""Alexa"". Make sure to disable voice purchasing or place a code if she will be in a room with a television.. there are lots of commercials where her name is called. She will respond.",2,2
I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it.,2,2
Love that I can read inside with the paper white. I replace my originalkindle with this.,2,2
I use this as a large mp3 player. you can buy a memory card to expand this unit. i put in 128gb card and have put 1000's of songs and still have not use up all the memory unlike my Ipad that fills up fast and has no way of expanding the memory.,2,2
"It's the amazon version of AppleTv. I guess I expected something a little more ""wow"" for the cost, but it looks like amazon's app on my xbox and smart tv. Not anything super special. It works as intended though and not really any problems. The remote feels flimsy compared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen 1-3",2,0
Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.,2,2
"I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it! You can play games (Although a bit laggy), watch movies/TV shows, read, and do quite a bit with it! The price is amazing! I would for sure buy this again and again! I recommend this if you are wanting a tablet to read! It is a great price for a pretty big screen! (But if you are wanting more of a game tablet I would recommend an Ipad or whatever is at best buy that they recommend.) I definitely think there is enough gigs for a few games and some books! My rating is 10/10!",2,2
This is an awesome product. Great for watching shows and movies!,2,2
Alexa knows all the answers and she's helping us be more efficient as we add light switches and a thermostat,2,2
"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads",2,2
I don't have cable so it would not be valuable to me,2,0
"I have bought 5 of these now for kids and for gifts. They are priced right, work well, and are easy to use. If you like your Android phone you will like this tablet",2,2
Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!,2,2
This device really helps my daughter improve in her reading and it is very simple to use.,2,2
Bought for my daughter because I love mine so much! Easy to use. Can see in the dark to read before bed - not so bright as a phone so it doesn't keep me up.,2,2
"Even though you need to have a Amazon prime membership to fully exploit the tab , it comes at a very very cheap price.",2,2
I purchased two. One for my wife and I for a trip to England. Easy to pack-stayed charged-readable in all lighting-we both like them.,2,2
Light weight easy to take with u . From reading to Facebook for all your little needs,2,2
I can watch a ton of shows now with this. Well worth the money,2,2
The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.,2,2
"Love the product, it does everything they say and some really cool other stuff not mentioned. Awesome",2,2
"I use my Echo to check on weather and traffic in the morning while getting ready for work. Also enjoy the music selection, news and sports info!!",2,2
This was easy to install and is very easy to use. No complaints at all!,2,2
"I absolutely love this tablet,and with a price you can't beat!",2,2
Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He does not do anything too extreme just basic apps. And it handles multiple apps well and for only $50 it was a great value deal. Excellent for games and light activities.,2,2
"I wanted the charger block with the folding power tines, but not available so I got this one and it works very well and I like it as much as the other type.",2,2
"The paperwhite allows you to read in any light, from the beach to a quiet night at home.",2,2
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.,2,2
"Amazon does it again. Worth every penny spent. Watch all movies, shows. I'm gonna purchase more!",2,2
As a tablet compared to others regardless of price I'd score it above average but the other tablets in comparrison cost $100+ more. This is the best buy for your money...hands down as long as you have amazon prime (which is awesome on its own).,2,2
"You get the most out of this if you have prime. Prime music is great with this, you may want to expand the memory with a card though.",2,2
"Gift for mom. didn't know if she would use it. Seems to be useful and makes it easy for her to listen to music. Also helps with weather, jokes tend to be corny. Hasn't used it to order anything. Got one for other family members and they seem to use it too.",2,2
I am pleased with my purchase. I use it daily. Ive downloaded several books. It has good picture quality and excellent sound.,2,2
"I bought this for my godson and so far he seems to love it. He has downloaded a bunch of games. His mom likes it because it's tied to her account and she was able to set parental controls for specific areas such as movies, etc. I do wish that it came with more than 8 GBs. Just purchased a case and screen protector separately because the kids version is way too much IMO.",2,2
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it,2,2
"While I haven't even begun to use all of the functions of the Echo, it has already shown that it is worth the price paid. It is entertaining, convenient, and just plain functional. The quality of the sound is fantastic, and yes, like other reviewers have said, it would be nice if it could be used in conjunction with a subwoofer. Even so, we are satisfied.",2,2
the back light nad easier to read in all lightings,2,2
Only regret not buying the larger one but I don't read alot at a time so it will work just fine,2,0
Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,2,2
Had a kindle fire before. Glad I switched. Easy to use and I love being able to read outside in the sun. Battery life is excellent!,2,2
Its a good tablet for my 6 yr old to play games and watch videos. Only thing is the charger doesnt stay in the port and battery doesnt last long,1,2
"Bought this for my 9 year old and he absolutely loves it! The free pre installed apps, the High color resolution. The overall quality is great. Unfortunately no Google products are on this tablet and chromecast is not an option (amazon firestick ready). This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5",2,2
Still learning but I would like to purchase another one in the near future!!,2,2
nice product,2,2
i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.,2,2
Works awesome. We are cable free thanks to the Fire tv,2,2
Very good product. Very useful in mamy scenarios..,2,2
"Wow, Alexa does it all! I can ask for pretty much anything, and I add new skills for her to learn all the time. It works perfect!",2,2
Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.,2,2
Product serves as reader and simple tablet. Used as personal device when traveling. Good product for the money.,2,2
Best,2,2
"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games.",2,2
"This is great. Stream all the Prime Video plus your normal stuff on YouTube Netflix, etc.",2,2
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.,2,2
Nice to have around house.May options to using this unit.,2,2
Alexa is great!!!! I should of bought one so long ago! I am looking to buy a Dot for upstairs now. Provides great sound!,2,2
"This is a great table for an amazing price! It's perfect for reading books, playing games, checking email, etc. I would definitely reccomend this!",2,2
Excellent product I love the back light on my kindle,2,2
I like that it is lightweight and it has the built in light.,2,2
Amazon fire tv is a great product save a lot of money not paying high cable prices,2,2
"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",1,0
My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day,2,2
"If you're looking for an all-in-one device that can surf the web, read e-books, watch videos, and more....look no further. I purchased this tablet for my daughter and she loves it. The price point is perfect too. It does not have HD or Retina display but it's not an issue for me.",2,2
Great tablet for reading and playing games. Graphics are great.,2,2
It was a gift for my 94 year old mother and she was able to learn how to use it fairly quickly.,2,2
Very pleased with this purchase. I no longer need cable tv service since I purchased this. Easy to set up. Simple remote control.,2,2
Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful,2,2
"I love how sturdy it is. It doesn't seem like it would be but it is great. I especially love how when you open it, the screen automatically turns on. I was hesitant at first about the color(Citron), but it looks so much better in person. It does take a flat surface to hold it up, meaning it's hard to use on a couch or bed, but it still works really really well!",2,2
"Purchased this for my 5 year old daughter so she could watch cartoons on Netflix. It's very durable, I use it sometimes myself, not a powerful as an iPad mini or galaxy tab but very good for the price.",2,2
Much better than I expected for such a great price.,2,2
This is my second fire tablet so I knew that this product would do all I needed plus the newer version had some extras like a camera. Works great for me.,2,2
The fire TV is excellent and allows me to watch in 4k. Works well.,2,2
This unit will charge faster than what came with the Amazon Fire HD-8. It's worth it. I can't stand waiting for charging!,2,2
"The amazon eco is extremely helpful and allows to enjoy numerous things, especially music.",2,2
Dandy,2,2
"I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version.",0,2
Love that you can ask anything and she responds right! Great product! Buying another one as we speak!,2,2
Good charger.,2,2
My children love their tablets plus they were more affordable than kid tablets. I just purchased a child proof case and downloaded the games they play. Totally worth it!,2,2
"Very nice tablet. Easy to use, screen is very bright and clear. Nice tablet for the money!",2,2
"I bought on sale for $35. My sister recommended Kindle tablets because of the text to speech feature. Some kindle ebooks have a text to speech feature. You can start reading at home then turn on text to speech fir when you are in the car stuck in traffic. We have a prime membership and you can save Amazon videos to watch offline. I haven't tried this yet but sounds great for plane or bus travel. You camn download the Overdrive app directly for free books, audio books,and video. I plan to download the Nook app so I can read Overdrive magazines and my Nook books. Micro sd slot for additional storage. Only mono sound which is fine for what I want to use it for. Cheap enough that I'll let the grandkids use it.",2,2
This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier,2,2
Easy to setup. My wife enjoys listening to Christian music while working. It has been a great buy!,2,2
"This was not a necessary product for my family, but we sure are having fun with it. At first I think my 7 year old thought we were talking through a microphone to a real person. He understands now that Alexa is not real, but he sure has fun asking questions and making requests. Overall, Alexa is really good at answering, and my whole family enjoys having her around. Hopefully there's not someone listening to everything that goes on in my house.:)",2,2
"I became a fan of ""Alexa"" from Day 1. I play my favorite music, use the alarm, check news and weather and even ask Alexa to ""tell me a joke!"". One of my best birthday presents!",2,2
Very similar to the fire stick but it seems a bit faster when downloading.,2,2
"I was using Nook glow light, migrating to paper white has been the bestKindle store provides plenty of books compared to nookBattery life is excellent , will last 2-3 weeks without recharging with daily use of 2 hours",2,2
Works perfectly user friendly and has voice recognition. Don't waste money on a roku or nexus player. Definitely worth the money. Can do 4k and even non 4k much better picture quality.,2,2
"Gotta say, I love this silly thing! Total light show, PLUS so much more!",2,2
It is a good product - enjoying more options for movies,2,2
I bought this for my Grandkids and they absolutely love them.,2,2
great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity,2,2
"Unless I'm not using it right, I can't voice search within apps outside of the amazon realm. Other than that, pretty sweet setup.",2,2
It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.,2,2
I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.,2,2
Perfect tablet for my 7 year old girl. She really enjoys it.,2,2
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price,2,2
"Great product, and it moves faster than the firesticks.",2,2
"Love my kindle paperwhite! Take it everywhere! Light enough to hold or carry, fits in most purses. Can read outside in bright sunlight, has built in adjustable backlight for reading in bed & not disturbing yourbedmate. Lots of storage & battery life is excellent. Highly recommend for purchase if you are looking for a black & white reader only!",2,2
Way faster then the stick. And better quality. Worth the extra money. Especially for kodi,2,2
Like the fact that this unit now includes Alexa. Hope that more Apps are available soon (seems Roku has a few that this one doesn't).,2,2
Great tablet for messing around with or just to have.,2,2
Amazon has done a good job but the reader is still a little on the small size for my liking. The light is a key feature for night readers. Interface is well laid out. Purchased for a family member who is happy with it.,2,2
"I really like it, I can see the letters perfectly and it has a perfect size",2,2
My wife loves this. the paperwhite is the way to go!,2,2
"I've had a couple different Kindles & have also tried to read books on my iPad & phone. LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. You can read it outside in the sun, by the pool, on your deck etc... & the print is always clear & visible. The battery stays charged for several days & it's small size makes it easy to carry in your purse or tote bag!",2,2
Excellent for reading and has lots of other uses with wifi,2,2
"I love how clear the screen is and no glare, it's amazing",2,2
"Run this with EMBY client and it works awesome. Love that it plays h265 no problem, one of the few that can actually do it. Highly recommend. ALOT FASTER than the stick in my opinion.",2,2
"I love how easy the Kindle is to operate. It is very intuitive, and requires only a short learning curve. Also it is one of the most economical ways to read books.",2,2
"This was a gift for my 7 year old granddaughter, so I have no input for this product.She seems happy with it.",2,2
The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone,2,2
"My first tablet! I was surprised it's just like my Samsung phone, and actually can sync programs and data with it. The wireless is great; I have no need for cell capabilities. It would be more power usage to search for cell, and most places I can use wi-fi. I use it as an alternative Kindle reader with the Kindle app. I also was amazed to find a free Microsoft Office Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, etc, although I haven't used them. This Tab A is sometimes kind of slow, but it was about $100 on sale, and great for the price. Very versatile. I'm very happy with it. I haven't needed extra memory yet, but good to know I can expand it with a microSD card.",2,2
Upgraded to voice controlled remot from the original fire tv. Love it. Don't think I even need to keep cable!!,2,2
Best Buy always has the lowest competitive pricing and great availability,2,2
We found this to be an excellent music source. Signed up for the $3/month Unlimited Amazon Music subscription. It's great to be able to request any kind of music at any time. Speaker quality is excellent as well. It was very easy to setup. Love that you can add items directly to a shopping list or a to do list. I would have given this 5 stars if the Search feature was more robust.,2,2
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.,2,2
I bought this for my Mom. She is 83 yrs old. She wanted it to put the Bible on it. She loves it's!,2,2
Fantastic gadget for reading. Excellent quality and the right price!,2,2
It's a great for reading books but it's not that great when it comes to everything else.,1,2
Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!,2,2
Awesome product like the layout used Roku in the past I really like this one way more than the Roku,2,2
My previous Kindle did not have the backlight so I upgraded to the Paperwhite in order to be able to read wherever I happened to be.,2,2
"I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device.",1,2
"This tablet is a great, all-in-one device. It does everything my husband (and my three children, and myself) need. This was the fifth Fire I've purchased in the last 3 years.",2,2
Fantastic for reading in dark conditions. Very light and easy to hold.,2,2
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family,2,2
I was looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly. Bonus it has camera lol,2,2
I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old. It is easy to use and i love the Kindle Freetime. Great price. Pretty durable.,2,2
"Alexa helps so much any questions answered turn off and on lights. I have an echo in every room your favorite stations artist songs all by asking Alexa. Ask for news, weather, alerts, notifications and anything you want. Alexa is part of the family now.",2,2
My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.,2,2
So far the Alexa Echo is very easy to use. I like the media and Amazon order follow up features best.,2,2
"Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.",2,2
It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.,2,2
This item is a thing of the future. You can littetly operate you wireless components using this debice.,2,2
Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv,2,2
its a great great gift that can be used by everyone,2,2
"Not an exact fit in our house , but an excellent speaker . Worth learning to use .",2,2
Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly,2,2
"I got it for my daughter who really loves it, it is very easy to use",2,2
"Great tablet for beginners, nice and simple. Great price",2,2
Good product.,2,2
Perfect for my 10 years old daughter. She loves it and that makes me happy.,2,2
"amazing deal, quick and fast menus, and 4k! cant be beat",2,2
"I wanted this tablet for reading books, checking e-ail and playing the occasional game. It works very well. I have also found the camera very convenient.",2,2
"Nice way to stream movies, .......................",2,2
"Nothing will replace the joy of flipping through the pages of a book, but living in a studio apartment with my girlfriend, I simply don't have the space for all the books I'd like to own on top of the ones I have now.I got this for my girlfriend because she has difficulty reading on my iPad Air. She has no difficulty using her Kindle Voyage, and she thoroughly enjoys it.I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself farther down the line.",2,2
"I'm not a huge fan of the modified Android interface on this tablet, and it is FAR from the best tablet on the market. Not even close. But I am giving it 5 stars based on its value. It is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera AND a microSD slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. Throw in the excellent integration with the Amazon ecosystem (if you use that) and you have a very worthwhile device. If you are not a big Amazon user, I don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultra-low-budget tablet.",2,2
I got this for $33 on Black Friday. Does what I need to do.,2,2
"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product.",2,2
Really good small tablet. Small and very convenient. Great visual quality.,2,2
"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.",2,2
I m pleased with Echo disappointed that it came late,2,2
Great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the PERFECT gift for a three year old.,2,2
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend",2,2
bought it for my niece and she loved it she was super happy,2,2
"I absolutely love Alexa, she can now play from my iTunes library when connected to my phone via Bluetooth. She is remarkable and I would choose Alexa over google voice.",2,2
"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV for use in a spare room. I subscribe to various platforms including Netflix and Playstation Vue. Although I am on a wireless connection, playback has been smooth, with almost no glitches. Not to mention, the picture quality has been superb (this can vary depending on the bandwidth of your internet connection). Setup was a breeze and it is very intuitive; so much so, that my 9 year old can use it with no problems (and after applying parental controls of course).",2,2
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it,2,2
"I LOVE my Paperwhite Kindle. The convenience of this product speaks for itself. I can read and purchase books anywhere, anytime.When my husband bought me my first Kindle 9-10 years ago, I opened it up and wasn't too sure I was going to like it. Boy was I wrong! I will never go back to books. Best product ever, well worth the money.",2,2
Great purchase! We use the Echo for playing a lot of music. The sound quality is really sharp.,2,2
Perfect gift for my mother and mother in law. Easy to use wonderful graphicsAwesome tablet,2,2
"This was purchased for my grandson for Christmas, he is so in love with it, Great price and quality. Will probably get another grandchild one.",2,2
"This is the best steaming device, to run many additional applications that will run smoothly.",2,2
"I got this as an upgrade for my old kindle & I love the new features! Crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations & tabs. Well organized. They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu. All around great product in my opinion.",2,2
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",1,1
"My son loves his tablet, easy access to the Internet and download games.",2,2
Love my tablet for the price I paidWill buy again .,2,2
"Its so small its easy to get lost under your TV! Its very fast, and easy to use. Log in to your amazon account and Netflix and Hulu and you have tons of options right at your fingertips!Have not really used alexa all that much so not sure how well it works overall. The phone app remote works pretty well so that is nice when you cant find the tiny fire TV remote/ too lazy to look for it! :) Some of the apps do not work all that great/ don't utilize surround sound but the main ones do. Got it on sale for $85. Definitely worth this price!",2,2
Set up was easy. Alexa so far has been on target and extremely helpful.,2,2
"Great product for the price. Whether it be for reading, playing games or surfing the web. Easy to use, good for all ages.",2,2
We had purchased this for our daughter. The parental control/profile features are great for her. Totally recommend!,2,2
got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.,2,2
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,1,2
"I love it! I gave it as a gift to my grandchildren, and they love it! We communicate through messages.",2,2
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it.",2,2
This tablet is great because you don't need a data plan but you can do anything that any other tablet can do maybe even a bit more. The only restriction is you need Wi-Fi to run it but let's face it Wi-Fi is everywhere now.,2,2
"Easy set up, and simple to learn various functions, including controlling wifi devices in my home.",2,2
My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.,2,2
Love the shopping app! Just tell Alexa to add an item and it goes to your phone! You never forget to take your shopping list again,2,2
A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.,2,2
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.,2,2
I would recommend to family and friends. I love it.,2,2
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday...",2,2
"So far so good,no problems and would recommend to everyone. Has crisp clear pictures and easy to navigate around without help or instruction manual.",2,2
This product is great and easy to use. It's an all in one entertainment product .,2,2
"I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it everyday. The paper white version is fantastic. There is no glare, it doesn't get too bright if the room is dark, and she uses it outside as well as in the car all the time with no screen issues! This device has been charged once and that was when we first got it. She hasn't had to charge it in over a month. Highly recommend!!!",2,2
Bought this for a xmas present but heard it play when a good friend bought it. Was very impressed with it's technology. I recommended it to another friend and she bought it for her daughter.,2,2
I absolutely love my fire tv it is amazing for everything,2,2
"I brought this for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it. She use it to do homework on, play games, watch videos. She loves it.",2,2
"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase",2,2
bought for my 5 yr old. He cant put it down. lots of educational apps.,2,2
"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!",2,2
"Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect reader. It's small size fits into a purse or carry all, and the light weight makes it very easy to hold. The response time when buying books is very fast. It is the perfect addition to the Kindle family. I also recommend purchasing the leather cover.",2,2
It is Great I Love It Got Rid Of Cable With The Fire Tv .,2,2
"After having been an Apple TV user (the older versions, of which I have 2) I decided to go with the amazon product because this one supports fox sports. That's the only reason I chose it. But after using it I have no complaints at all. I haven't yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet, not sure if it's possible or not. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy one of these devices.",2,0
"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day.",2,1
She started using it the same day and reads books every day now.,2,2
Easy setup nice size only thing is the charger cords need to be more sturdy.,2,2
This is a wonderful tablet. The processor is fast. I'm able to watch movies with no buffering. Tons of apps. This is an excellent value!,2,2
My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.,2,2
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.",2,2
"this item was on a hefty sale, bought two for work purposes. a bit slow and annoyed by the constant Amazon notifications / integrations but it will work for the purpose of check emails and viewing photos.",1,0
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Screen is easy to read indoors and out.,2,2
I guess since I'm saying that this is perfect for reading 4 stars seems cheeky. It's just that since I'm used used using a tablet which is definitely faster but at least I can read anywhere and there is no glare from the sun and it's not too bright which helps with eyestrain.,2,2
"Wife likes it, and I can sleep at night without the room getting lit up.",2,2
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.",2,2
This tablet is inexpensive and user friendly for my toddler. He loves it and uses great educational apps.,2,2
"I didnt realize, even though I should have, that I could not add whatever programs I wanted to for it. I wanted to get this so I could play games on the tablet while home, instead of my phone. I was able to install one of the two games I play, but was unable to with the second. I will actually be returning it because that means I have no use for it. My wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time.",1,2
"Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision.",2,2
My daughter has enjoyed it very much!!!! She loves using the camera. And playing the games she just loves it. We have to put it on charge and she is asking 5 minutes later is it charged yet!!!! Really is kid friendly,2,2
The kindle paperwhite is absolutely a perfection. It is perfect for just picking up a book and instantly starting where you left off. The lighting is so realistic it feels like you're just reading real paper. Definitely a bargain.,2,2
"I have an Echo or an Echo Dot in almost every room in my house! The Echo has incredible sound for such a small device. The Echo Dot is not that hot as a speaker, but both of them work great for controlling your other smart home devices. I personally have it set up to control my Hue lights, my Schlage Connect lock (with a Wink Hub), and my Logitech Harmony Hub to control my entertainment system! Fantastic buy!",2,2
She was so excited to receive it and likes that she can read it outside in the sun or inside in the dark. Big improvement over the original Kindle which I also gave her.,2,2
I love the price of this product. And for the price it gives you Big Bang for the buck. My wife does not use electronics and she has no problem using this.,2,2
"I bought two one for my son and one for me. Great tablet, at a reasonable price.",2,2
I love it. Quick for information and have started converting components in the house to smart home setup.,2,2
Could not get this to work with my chromecast so I returned it.,0,0
"I love, love, love this Kindle Fire 7. I Like the size, the quality and most especially, the price. This product greatly exceeded my expectations. I use it every day. I recommend this Kindle Fire 7 to anyone who is thinking of buying a Kindle Fire. I am telling all of my friends about it!",2,2
Great little tablet. Bought for my neice to mess around on. Does everything the expensive ones do for a fraction of the cost.,2,2
I will definitely purchase another tablet a larger size for me at a different time.,2,2
"Talk to Echo to tun on my lights, and set timers all the time",2,2
"Compared to the Galaxy kids tablet, this was a better deal and more durable for children below 12 yrs. old.",2,2
I think this product works good. I would recommend it.,2,2
this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it,2,2
"The Amazon Echo was easy to setup straight out of the box, and my family began using it immediately. We are learning new things it can do every week. The sound quality is amazing, and this has become the primary music source for my house. When purchasing, I would have preferred a black Echo, but white is all this Best Buy had at the time (before Xmas), but white looks very clean on our kitchen counter where it sits. There are some words Alexa is still struggling with understanding, but we do have a bit of a Texas drawl, so I think we're getting used to each other.",2,2
"She understand almost everything, she is quickly to respond and you can actually synchronize your fire stick with it as well",2,2
I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.,2,2
"Great tablet for beginner, especially with wifi function and ebook purposes",2,2
The Amazon Echo is very easy to set up and is very useful. It is also fun to use. I keep learning new things it can do on a daily basis.,2,2
This product is excellent for what we need.....only internet!,2,2
This is by far the best kindle to come out. Backlight is great!!,2,2
so far so good I own this for almost a year and no freeze when Im watching a movie via stream,2,2
so easy to set up. great App selection. should have purchased this sooner.,2,2
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.,2,2
Easy to set up and very functional. Definitely would buy again as a gift,2,2
Fine quality. I love the options available with the Amazon Fire tv.,2,2
"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better.",2,2
Great price for an awesome tablet. Awesome tablet to read my books.,2,2
I prefer apple products myself. But this is perfect for children,1,2
"Was very easy to set up and use, has been a joy to just ask Alexa to play my favorite music and even tell jokes! Highly recommend this product!",2,2
"Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient",2,2
I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.,0,0
Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion,0,2
Very easy to setup and even more importantly easy to use.,2,2
I bought two of this tablets and they are great tablets with the best prize in the market.,2,2
"excellent device, very fast especially when connected to ethernet",2,2
Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!,2,2
The kindle fires have been great for the grandbabies.,2,2
I bought this item as a gift and I've heard great things about the paper white Kindle. I'm thinking about getting one myself!,2,2
Recognizes all commands as long as you speak clearly and there are no other noises. Works like Siri your personal assistant.,2,2
"The reader is great, with a crisp display and excellent battery life. I like having the option of either using the buttons to flip pages, or just swipe it. The latter always required two hands, so the buttons can make it easier.",2,2
Buy a heavy duty screen protector had ours less than a month glass is shattered unable to find a place to fix it .. Do not buy this for kids grandson is 11 ...,2,0
"This is a great product, that doesn't have a lot of distraction for kids. Great little reader for the price",2,2
"this is a great tablet at a great price. unfortunately it can't connect to google play without hacking. if that's what you need, look at the acer tablet. if you are looking for an inexpensive fire tablet, you can't go wrong with this.",2,2
"Unbelievable! Everyone should get one! I wasn't sure if use it, but I do all of the time.",2,2
Was looking for streaming device. Weren't sure if I want to pay $100 for 1 but it was on sale for $70 so decide to buy it. Did research and found it allow me to install dev app to connect to other server source for streaming so bought it instead of roku or apple.,2,0
Easy to work no issues my daughter loves it and my 6 year old loves it too,2,2
"This is my third kindle, and I am thrilled with the new display! Money well spent",2,2
"Lightweight, easy on the eyes, easy to use, many wonderful features",2,2
"I dumped cable after using streaming and Playstation Vue. I have one Fire TV in my bedroom and loved it so I bought a Fire Stick for downstairs. The Fire Stick was slow by comparison, so I upgraded and have no issues with the Fire TV. The Fire TV is worth the extra money. The variety of services offered and the speed pays off if you have a good connection. I do not have 4K, but I can only assume it will be a quality stream when I do.",2,2
"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though.",2,2
"Its a good tablet with very nice screen and functions. As with amazon fire tablets , you are stuck with apps on amazon and you may not get too many variety and good quality apps. If you are ok with Amazon apps, this is a fine nice tablet.. If you need good and verities of apps, go for android tablet.",1,2
"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool.",2,2
"In process of comparing the Amazon Echo to the Google Home. So far the Echo has a leg up as it plays music that I get ""free"" from my Amazon Prime membership - would recommend this product to others",2,2
"There is so much to do with the Echo, that I am still getting to know it. Everyday, I learn and try a new skill. Great device, great price!",2,2
Wait for to be on sale it's worth it definitely you will love it,2,2
This is pretty good. A little expensive but work fine.,2,2
I love this item because I just love all electronics,2,2
very good just don't forget to ask for the none promo one,1,2
"The sound from this unit is just incredible and with almost 20 million songs for $3.99 to $7.99 a month depending on the Amazon plan, it just doesn't get any better. Add in the fact it controls all the lights in my home, my Samsung robot vacuum and can answer almost any question I ask her, it is hard to imagine life without my Alexa...",2,2
This product was for a 13 year old and it was perfect for his needs at a great price,2,2
Amazing deal for solidly built tablet. If you're looking for some thing basic this is the one,2,2

Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.,1,0
I am so glad i procrastinated in buying an e-reader.I was going to get the kindle paperwhite- then the Voyage came out- I bought it and am so happy with it- a joy to use.,2,2
"The screen is cool. Much better than the basic kindle. Very similar to the kindle voyage. If you want a really reading experience, you need a kindle.",2,2
if you want to have multiple apps this is what to get,2,2
Bought extra for a gift. Plan to give it for a Christmas present.,2,2
you can not fail on Amazon. I primarily use for reading books and watching prime video without any problem. Love this little thing!,2,2
Its a tablet under 50$ that performs well and is reliable. A must have.,2,2
"My son loves this tablet. I would recommend for kids under teenage age. Great display, not much storage but can add SD card.",2,2
Really enjoying our Amazon Echo. Have programmed lights and am looking forward to other things.,2,2
"This is my second Amazon Fire, purchased it from Best Buy for a Christmas gift, when a deal was running. After opening the package found a scratch on the screen. Took the product to Store Best Buy changed it promptly. The new one is quiet right.",2,1
"I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The ""squeeze the edge"" for a page turn is what sold me.",2,2
It protects my Kindall and I can take it and put it in my purse if not get scratch because I like to read my Kimball we have places waiting for people. And it's a nice color and it's very nice.,2,2
"Very pleased with the performance. Thought i would miss turning pages, but I don't. Some may prefer a larger screen. I would buy again.",2,2
Kindle does everything as advertised. Easy on the eyes and great in sunlight.,2,2
This is the 2nd Fire I purchased. Had to return the first due to a flaw creating an inability to connect to wifi. So far this one works great. Use it mostly for reading.,2,2
Main reason for getting the Amazon TV was for better streaming experience of PlayStation Vue. The Amazon Fire TV handles Vue streaming w/o issues and the interface is very easy and user friendly. I also like the ability to root the device for third party apps.,2,2
This kindle paper white is an excellent choice for reading on the beach or in sunlight,2,2
"this is great, really easy to use - the playlists are fantastic",2,2
I love this product it very great for my son. My son educational apps on here,2,2
It would be nice if there were more interaction with Home Entertainment Deivices. Only purchased because works with Harmony Remote.,1,2
"Gave it as a gift, but my father absolutely loves it. he had been using one of the old Kindle DX readers.",2,2
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air,2,2
Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.,2,2
"Was hoping the screen a little bigger, but over all great picture, easy to use",2,2
Amazing value for money tablet !!!Best in this price point.Got it for 39$ on sale from Brst Buy.Solid built and quite a rugged product.,2,2
Easy to use and integrate with Nest and Philips Hue. I like that new features seem to be added frequently.,2,2
Bought it for a gift for our 21 year old daughter. She wanted a speaker and then decided on this. Her roommates LOVE it! She likes the white.,2,2
It takes practice and getting familiar with it. It is fun.,1,2
"Love it! I use it for weather, Pandora, you can play games and ask it recipes. It's great.",2,2
I purchased this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it.,2,2
"I have had several Kindles beginning with the 1st generation. I am an avid reader and I love that I can take my library with me. The Kindle Voyage is by far my favorite. The printed page is very clear and the lit page is wonderful. If you enjoy reading as much as I do, this is the e-reader for you.",2,2
This item is ok if your not looking for a big name brand tablet.,2,2
"Good tablet for adult, it is great when installing xbmc/kodi and stream vidoes online",2,2
This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it,2,2
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members.",2,2
"Amazon Fire is perfect for families on the go! It fits well into backpacks, purses and briefcases!",2,2
Sadly no having netflix support is resulting in my last tablet purchase from Amazon.,0,0
"I like this Kindle, but I am not sure it is worth the premium over the Paperwhite. I previously had a Kindle Fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. But it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it.",2,2
This is much better than an iPad or Android tablet for reading. Can't go wrong!,2,2
"This is great toy. You may not need it, but you'll want it, and love it when you start using it.",2,2
This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.,2,2
kids love the tablet & the picture quality is good,2,2
We bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them. Nice prenatal features to limit use and restrict content in the Amazon eco system. Build quality seems good. Glad we choose these over the cheaper brand that was only a few bucks less.,2,2
I really enjoy using the Fire 7 tablet. It is light weight and fits in my purse for caring around. Now I always have a good book to read.,2,2
Works great for everyday use. The family loves it.,2,2
"If you haven't bought one of these already, I suggest you do so. You won't be disappointed.",2,2
"We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying ""Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly.",2,2
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.,2,2
"OK, let's face it. Kindles are not the fastest nor do they come with a quad core processor. But they are great for simple reading and light web browsing. But for 39.99 on sale it was a steal. Thanks Best Buy!",2,2
When I was looking for something to get so I could have all my books on one the Kindle is the first thing I thought of and ended up getting. The only thing I don't like about it is when it is dark the screen can be kind of bright even with the blue shade on. I also I have trouble spelling on the keyboard.,2,2
"Love this device. I have a 16 month old that is hard set to get to nap and go to bed. Currently still on a vacation, and have been very pleased with the ease of putting on Sesame Street on the hotel tv via hbogo. no little tablet or phone needed, and has perfect picture quality",2,2
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.,2,2
"LOVE IT VERY GOOD IDEM,Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY",2,2
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Best tablet for the money.,2,2
"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect.",2,2
I purchased this kindle to replace one I had for several years. So far it has preformed great. Easy to use and holds a charge well.,2,2
This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do,2,2
"I have been very hesitant of cutting that cable cord, but I decided to buy the Amazon Fire TV and test it out. I cut the cable cord the next day. Well worth the purchase and the savings from not having cable tv.",2,2
"We got the new Amazon fire TV as we got a new 4K tv. Right now there is still not as much 4K content as I would like, however it does 4K very well. Netflix and Amazon prime have a few 4K tv shows and movies that are available if you have a 4K tv, but the New Fire TV also has upgraded internals and faster wireless making everything much snappier. I would recommend a wired connection if you can, streaming will look much better and pause much less often.",2,2
"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",1,0
I am amazed by the touch quality and the feel of the page turning.,2,2
"I've bought kindles before so we were already familiar with the product. It works just as great as the other ones and is a nice little size. Picture is better on our other ones, but that's because the other ones are HD. Great purchase for a great price!",2,2
"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain.",2,2

Home automation is right around the corner with the Amazon Echo. Great companion....period.,2,2

His streaming device is awesome. So much better than my roku. Options options options is all I have to say,2,2

"For the price, the Kindle Paperwhite was a great upgrade to the old Kindle. The back light was a plus when using on a plane, and the charged lasted throughout the two week trip.",2,2
"The Amazon Echo is awesome to play music, get news updates and ask questions. It helps me with timers for cooking and even lets you play jeopardy. I love it",2,2

I have been a book fan and was surprised how much I love this.,2,2
"I bought this to replace an aging Apple TV and have been very pleasantly surprised with it. It streams in 4k, which my Apple TV did not do, and I have Kodi installed to stream media from a home server to my TV. Great product and worth the money!",2,2
This product is really cool and fun to have. Hooked from day one.,2,2
This is a nice budget tablet especially as a starter tablet.,2,2
Got this because it was on sale and I had a gift card. It is extremely slow using the internet. Hoping to be using it was an e-reader.,0,2
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube,2,2
"This is a great new product. Speaker sound quality it pretty good, and I love being able to stream music without a phone or tablet. It can tell you the news and weather and is learning new functions all the time. I think this is the wave of the future. It is nice having my own personal assistant around the house...now only if it could make me breakfast.",2,2
"Works great. Nice upgrade over the Fire stick as it has an Ethernet port. Heavily focused on Amazon content (duh) but if you have a Prime account, this is a must.",2,2
"I bought this product to replace my nvidia sheild. I'm glad that I did. I have noticed that while streaming video that buffering is almost non existent. In my opinion, this is the best platform available for running the Kodi app.",2,2
It's an alright tablet for my parents to learn and use for Skype,1,2
I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.,2,2
enjoying this tablet. purchased so I could have a bigger screen for shopping when I don't wanna pull my laptop out. so far it is serving the purpose. didn't know it came in colors until I opened it.,2,2
the size is perfect ....the battery excellent ....got it on a sale .....love it,2,2
My wife has enjoyed this tablet a lot. She plays a lot of card games and looks up recipe.,2,2
I bought this for my 79 year old mother. It works great and provides some info as well as entertainment. I wish it could dial her iPhone for her. Maybe next version...,2,2
"So in reading the reviews before I got this cover I was quite worried... lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. I was so concerned in fact I tried to cancel my order. I'm glad I wasn't able to.It is perhaps not what people expect- the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. However, this cover does NOT feel cheap to me. It is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. It fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. It also feels quite secure in the hand.So, to sum up: Light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. The 40 price tag could be debated, but I actually don't find it to be overpriced. I'm quite happy with it!",2,2
My mom is 89 and has a hard time with technology. This Kindle is simple and easy for her to use. It has fulfilled all of her basic needs.,2,2
"Bought this as a christmas gift for a family member, I've heard nothing but good things about it. Great little tablet for a great price.",2,2
"Bought this tablet for my mom as a birthday day gift. She loves it. This is her first tablet and shes learning how to use it. I was very impressed with how quick and responsive it was. Also it has an excellent display and runs just like 200+ tablets, Will play all your favorite apps.",2,2
Setting up the Echo was very easy. That is good since I am not very tech savy. Love it.,2,2
Amazing. Works well. Everything runs quick and smooth and good price.,2,2
My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!,2,2
Great Item everyone should keep purchasing from best buy,2,2

I have slowly started to smartify my house. Alexa does great with the smart switches and plugs I have in the house. It makes it very convenient when you have your hand full when first getting home.,2,2
This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books,2,2
"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining",2,2
Bought this for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it! Easy to use and kid friendly.,2,2
"Awesome to have, verry convient. I would like to have one in every room.",2,2
"I was hesitant in buying one of these but I took the risk and the risk paid off. It's an amazing piece of hardware in a little box, not to mention a stylish box. If your looking for a streaming box? Look no further!",2,2
Review is based on the fact that I have not able to make a connection with the device.,0,2
"I was surprised at how much I like this amazon fire tv. I own a Apple TV and a roku. I really like it because I have amazon prime and amazon unlimited music and this really makes those services shine! It's nice to watch the prime provided content, movies, tv shows, and amazon original series. The Alexa inabled remote is also very nice.",2,2
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! I love the free time app.,2,2
I had a hard time trying to work this it could not understand me most of the time everything seem to be hard to work for me.,0,0
"I bought this for my gran as a Christmas gift. She plays games on it all day, checks her Facebook and loves it. Super easy to use. If she can anyone can.",2,2
"I was hesitant to get a tablet because I was unsure as to how it works and adding a new technology can sometimes be challenging. The Best Buy rep directed me to the Amazon Fire for it's ease of use and he was spot on. Also, the email ""introducing"" me to my tablet was invaluable and helped me immensely. A nice addition to the helpfulness of staff at your store.",2,2
Easy too use and a plus for wife to read books being a prime member,2,2
"Great if you read alot of magazines, books or plan to spend alot of $ for music and stuff...most aps arnt available like google play store",1,2
Decent and simple tablet that gets the job done.Excellent!,2,2

"Great for my one year old baby,he loves to play games and watch movies..",2,2
It is easy & flexible to use. Much less expensive than other tablets.,2,2
Bought a fire TV player to replace an aging PS3. Works as advertised. Alexia can be a little quirky at times however.,2,2
I bought this for travel so I can read as much as I can without bartering and carrying books. It's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. I have to hold it with two hands. I was hoping I could hold it in one. In retrospect I would get the Amazon Fire instead.,1,2
"Very fun and entertaining, works with my hopper 3 through Dish and my ecobee 3 thermostat",2,2
"I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc.",2,2
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading.",2,2
"I like my new amazon fire. Great price for a tablet. I choose it for my daughter Christmas gift. Since she is 7 years old, she need to study a lot on some apps her school required. She love play apps games too. It's a must.",2,2
So far this product has worked great. I bought it to replace my kindle charger that was no longer charging my older kindle fire. I bought a new USB cord as well. It charges my kindle so much faster than any of the other chargers I have. I would definitely recommend this product.,2,2
For the money you just can't beat this little tablet!! I have used it quite heavily! I used it during a trip I took and had to rely on it while my computer was in the shop for over a week and it has performed beautifully!! I would recommend this product to anyone!!,2,2

Bought for drivers to log into peoplenet for work. Very easy to navigate. We luv it,2,2
"This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all.",2,2
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend.",2,2
They are the best choice for everybody in the family i bought for my family and they truly live it and it was a great supper dooper deal.,2,2
Great tablet for kids of any age. It's cheap and user friendly. You can even set controls so there is an age timer as well. It's perfect!,2,2
This is better then the fire stick much faster streaming less lag,2,2
very easy to use. was bought to use with Kindle. happy with my purchase!!,2,2
last year I bought three for my older grand kids this year I bought one for the younger one and they all love it.,2,2
Got it for my son. He loves everything about it & likes that it even fits in most of his jean pockets.,2,2
The echo has a great sound for a small product. The convenience alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.,2,2
Amazon Products are easy to use and navigate thru.,2,2
Brought this for my daughter she loves it. Really like that she can make her own profile for all her pbs kids and Disney jr apps.,2,2
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!,2,2
"Very useful,Very handy.Best when you travel due to prtability",2,2
Compared these headphones to beats. Satisfied with the purchase!,2,2
It is a good inexpensive tablet. It lags occasionally but is great for something to watch movies or television while waiting for an appointment or anywhere with free wifi.,2,2
Streams much better than smart tv does. Well worth it,2,2
interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.,2,2
At first I didn't understand all the hype about Alexa. But then I finally gave in and decided to purchase. And I am so glad I did. Volume goes loud and she listens and responds immediately.,2,2
I own 3 in my household. To me no other streaming box comes close. A definite must buy !,2,2
The Amazon Fire is a very good tablet that is very user friendly and the price is great.,2,2
Always learning new stuff. This tech toy is very useful.,2,2
"This e-reader does not strain my eyes and works great in any lighting, including full sun.",2,2
My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.,2,2
"If your familiar with Echo, you know what you're going to get. Alexa does not have all the answers however. Price is pretty much the same everywhere.",2,2
"I bring it with me every where. I read my books on it, surf the web, and play my favorite games on it.",2,2
"I got this as a gift for my friend. It has a nice sleek look to it. You have to have the app to access all of its features, but overall it's fun to use.My only complaint is it needs to be consistently plugged in. It would be nice if it had a long lasting battery that would allow us to place it where we want, but aside from that. It's been fun",2,2
"Clear, easy to use, easy to read, This is my 2nd paperwhite & would buy again.",2,2
"For the price, this tablet is great! Does what is needed and its sleek.",2,2
"The amazon echo is great. It has amazing sound. I like the ability it can be operated from your phone, online, and by voice control.",2,2
I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.,2,2
Great product... Met all my expectations,2,2
Opened the box and was able to quickly and easily hook up to my wifi. Great to play music through.,2,2
Great table for the price. You can download games and so much more. Its great for young kids.,2,2
It's a great product. I not only have books that I read on there but also can download games for my kids.,2,2
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with,2,2
"After only 4 days, the device would not charge. It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet.",0,0
I was pleasantly surprised when I got this as a gift. Unlimited fun.,2,2
Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.,2,2
I love this speaker. It does everything you could ever imagine. Love the fact that I can order something from amazon by just talking to Alexa.,2,2
"Easy to set up, sound not bad for a Kitchen Location. Use it everyday!",2,2
"My husband loves it, he even gets on facebook. And he loves playing games on it!",2,2
This has been excellent purchase as avid reader it has been a pleasure bringing hours of entertaining joy. I love the lightweight sleek design & size. I take it everywhere. It is easy to use & capable of downloading everything I need.,2,2
I get frustrated with this alot. I like being able to speak commands but she never seems to know much even though we add skills to her. She is always saying she doesnt know that. The speaker is not the quality that I would expect for the price.,1,2
Since purchasing this product I rarely ever watch live tv anymore. It does exactly what I wanted it to.,2,2
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.",2,2
"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight.",2,2
"The integration to my home automation is transparent, I hope devices offered a way/skill to connect to all systems so I could have running amazon-google-apple-microsoft at the same between them.Amazon per what I researched was the best at my time of purchase, and it really makes it simple. It delivers on what they promise.",2,2
I bought one for myself and it is my first kindle. Just love it and got a second as a birthday gift to one of my friends.,2,2
"I had a Nook, but it died so I wanted a replacement, and bought this Fire tablet on black friday last year because it was very inexpensive, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. It's OK for basic web surfing, but it's limited, slow, and has one little speaker on the back so if you lay it on a table you won't be able to hear it very well.",0,0
Bought for my mother for book reading. It's bigger than her phone and holds more. She really likes it.,2,2
Gift for my sister and she is loving it!! Would definitely consider getting one for myself.,2,2
"I like the convenience of my Kindle a lot for reading, and the process for buying books from Amazon is easy and flawless, as well as cheaper than buying physical books. There are a lot of $1.99 specials of very good books. I just wish the Kindle was slightly larger - more the size of a typical paperback book - because when I'm reading it feels like I'm ""turning"" a page every few seconds.",2,2
I purchased two Amazon Fire pads for my kids. It has everything they need and you can't beat the price!!!,2,2
I purchased the Kindle Fire as a replacement for my Nook Tablet. My hope was that it would be a reasonable replacement for what I essentially was primarily using as an E-reader. It has surpassed all of my expectations at a much more reasonable cost.,2,1
MY WIFE DEARLY LOVES COMMUNICATING WITH ALEXA> SHE IS CONSTANTLY ASKING ALEXA FOR INFORMATION ON TIME< WEATHER< MUSIC AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THE INTERNET HAS TO OFFER,2,0
Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased,2,2
I have owned this Amazon echo for almost two months now and I am enjoying it.,2,2
I bought it for my fiancé and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.,2,2
i love to read book on that device. i would recommend this,2,2
I found this unit easy to setup. It also allowed me to view my Netflix account without wearing out my PlayStation .,2,2
"using echo for weather, music, and asking questions. Worry about ordering stuff online.Still learning all the things you can do with alexa.",2,2
This item ties in perfectly with my new Alarm system with camera's and thermostat control.,2,2
"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,",2,2
Speaker is much better than the smaller one but can be connected to other speakers as well. Easy to do literally everything via voice.,2,2
"This tablet is a great price and perfect for kids, however the picture quality could be better",2,2
I really like my fire. So much to do and easy to use.,2,2
"Great tablet and its price for it, it's awesome my kids love it and it keeps them entertained.",2,2
This tablet is great. So glad I purchased this item.,2,2
Great little streamer. Little to no buffering for amazon prime. Easy to load Kodi for expanded fealtures.,2,2
This is simple tablet to use for any beginner or kids,2,2
Based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your socks off but is good for children that like to read books.,1,2
great and easy to use budget tablet for 35 when I purchased it. Get one,2,2
Easy setup and use. Couldn't ask for a better product.,2,2
my husband loves this gift I bought this for Christmas,2,2
"The Amazon echo is a fun item for entertainment, and provides lots of options for games, and general help, like a 'ask jeeves'.",2,2
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing.",2,2
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.,2,2
"I love my Amazon Echo! The sound is phenomenal. She is very responsive and is so easy to use. We love ordering from Amazon with it, using it to teach our kid animal noises and even playing games!",2,2
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.,2,2
I mostly use my echo paired with my Phillips hue system to control the lights. I also use it for setting alarms and timers and occasionally a flash news briefing,2,2
"I Love it! It is easy for anyone to use. Easy to transport, too.",2,2
Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.,2,2
Love it! This is my second Kindle. Would definitely recommend it.,2,2
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.,2,2
"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it",2,2
"Did not need a large tablet,just something to use in my spare time.Has all the features I need,from books to games and can also axcess my emails.The price was very good(under $50).",2,2
Enjoy my Amazon fire tv box work great lots better than the fire stick no more buffering,2,2
Just what I needed,2,2
I bought the Echo primarily for it's voice control of devices and secondarily to listen to music. As an ambient music player it is better than I had expected and am using it more for that than I had anticipated.Setup was easy. I expect to be connecting more devices and using more as time goes on.,2,2
Our kids use these and they are a great tablet for the price. Handy for reading ebooks. They don't have quite the wifi range as a laptop but otherwise work fine.,2,2
Alexa works great and I like that she learns as she goes I even got 3 dots to work just like her.,2,2
I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.,2,2
I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn't have with my old kindle.,2,2
Bought for my grandson who is four and he can operate it like a champ,2,2
"I purchased this as a gift, the kids can't get enough of it. They now enjoy reading more.",2,2
"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.",2,2
I love my fire stick it provided hours of entertainment,2,2
"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.",2,0
Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card!,2,2
"Great product if you need to read e-books, good battery life.",2,2
"We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.",1,0
My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles,2,2
I never expected this small device could have so many features. Its good but you need to buy a memory extension,2,2
Easy to set up. Great definition and apparently comes with a prime subscription.,2,2
This box has a ton of apps and features on it as it comes... and it gets even better once you install KODI!,2,2
I decided on purchasing instead of the name brands,2,2
"It was a cheap tablet just for kids to watch movies. However, it forces you to put your credit card numbers to register the product. I don't want to since kids will be playing with it. I don't want them to be able to purchase apps without approval. Reset it to factory default, but the setup changed not the same as first started. Anyway, I won't but it again.",0,0
Easy to setup. Bought Amazon Echo for the living room and Amazon Dot for the bedroom. Fantastic AI.,2,2
"My parents had a Kindle Paperwhite they were sharing and loved it so much they wanted another one so they wouldn't have to take turns anymore. Unless you're looking for the full Android experience with the Fire or FireHD, this is the best Kindle model - the Voyager model doesn't add enough to justify it's higher cost. My tech-adverse mother absolutely adores her Paperwhite!",2,2
"Great, I can watch anything I want with hd quality",2,2

So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.,2,0
I have been wanting an Amazon echo for quit sometime. It is everything and more then what I hoped for. It's an incredible speaker on top of being the best source for all information.

great device...a lot of learning to do. we hsve a lot more of exploring to do with Alexa,2,2
"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram.",2,2
This is my second Kindle as I updated from a previous model. This is lighter more comfortable to hold and the internal light is amazing.,2,2
Great Value On A Tablet. I bought this for travel. At $49 if you lose or drop it you are not out $100's of dollars. It performs great.,2,2

"I have my Alexa in the kitchen on counter, and it is fun to ask questions about weather, sing songs and about recipes. I bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my neighbor, we both LOVE it! It's fun to speak out loud and interact with Alexa. Thanks for making a great product Amazon!!",2,2
I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.,2,2
I love this tablet! It's the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable!,2,2
"Perfect for kids to play, read online through wi-fi. Touch response is a bit slow.",2,2
"Got this for my daughter that is entering 6th grade. Not only is she reading more, but reading more complex books and expanding her vocabulary tremendously with the word ""look up"" feature. Screen is free of glare and looks much like a paper book as the name implies. Great for learning and recreational reading.",2,2
I was setting up 2 of the same tablet and this one wouldn't connect to the wifi. When I brought it back for an exchange there were none in store and they didn't even have them on their website! Ended up getting a refund and purchasing the same model from Amazon,0,0
Is Great product. Easy to set up. Worked instantly.,2,2
My first dedicated streaming box and it works great. Plenty of apps to watch my shows and the remote is simple to learn. Also having access to my Amazon purchased movie and prime shows/movies is a nice bonus.,2,2

"The Amazon Echo is great! My whole family is enjoying it. I got it for Father's day, and have used daily since then. Alexa is amazing! Her voice recognition is unbelievable, and it even compensates for my foreign accent. My only complaint is that the the Echo volume isn't high enough for me. That's why I gave it a 4-star rating.",2,2
Its a great reader. I use it at night instead of my phone and its much easier on the eyes. And the battery seems to last forever.,2,2
I left my old kindle on an airplane and had to purchase a new one. This one is much easier to use. The controls are more intuitive and loading books from my library in the cloud is so easy now!,2,2
I bought two of these for my daughters. Works great for the kids and if they drop them and break your not out a huge chunk of money like you would be for an IPad.,2,2
Echo is like having your own personal assistant. It's a blast to wake up every morning and finding out how traffic is and what the weather forecast looks like.,2,2

It works well and for the price you can't go wrong.,2,2
Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.,2,2
An interesting addition to the home. Easily recognizes speech from multiple sources and is able to answer most questions. It is a bit complicated to get all set up and to determine what is free and what requires subscriptions. Works very well.,2,2
Echo is wonderful and super smart. Love you can interrupt a skill and she will return to it when finished with what you asked her.,2,2
"My grandchildren each received a Kindle fire and have downloaded books, and games best Christmas gift ever.",2,2

Great addition to the family room. Easy to set up and use.,2,2

Echo is good for listening to music and quick information. Great for hands free timers and alarms.,2,2
"Good for the price, but that's not it! The interface is clean as ipad and but there is limitation in app stores. Initially I tried to use this Fire tablet to cast videos to my TV which has the Chromecast embedded. I have not figured out how I can do it. Beautiful display, easy transition from my paperwhite, connected easily to my wifi. I haven't done much yet except read books. It looks so pretty! TANGERINE is so pretty! Good Price as well!",2,2
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value.",2,2

"Being an avid reader with a preference towards hardbacks I was very skeptical of e-readers. Because I also travel extensively carrying hardbacks and having enough lighting to read has been a challange. My husband purchased a Kindle Paperwhite for me for Christmas. Upon opening I wasn't sure I was ready to go digital - HOWEVER I love it, I've already completed 2 books. The paperwhite is backlit and easy to hold. It fits in the palm of my hand so one handed reading is easy. I am now a believer ....",2,2
So far so good. Display is not as bright or clear as my iPhone but then again I only paid 30 dollars for the tablet,1,2
Great for home use and makes a great housewarming gift!,2,2
"Great product to start home automation. A bit kludgy for some due to enunciation which frustrates some. For most people it is good and with patience it will learn, but you need to be patient.",2,2
"Everyone should have one because it has so many great features. Listen to music, control home security, find out what the weather is and all by just asking.",2,2
"Love this gal. We play games, listen to music, set mood lighting, etc. and she always listens to me! Best Buy had best price. Tired of being ignored? Buy one now!",2,2
"I previously owned the previous model. There is very little difference between this and the older model. (Apart from the 4K, which only works with Netflix at this time). I still hate the ugly interface!, I wish Amazon would allow users to use their own skins",0,0
My son loves this tablet because of all the apps on the store. we love it because of the parental controls allow us to control what he gets in the app store lol,2,2
Taking some time to figure it all out but I love it!!,2,2
"What a difference and got a super deal before Christmas. The new Kindle Fire not only does UHD with my monitor, the interface is really nice. I think it's much better than the Roku 3 I have been using and the Roku 4 that couldn't recognize my UHD HDMI port. It would only do 1080p. Plan to buy another to replace my Roku 3, for a 1080p TV. NICE!",2,2
Much prefer reading books on my Kindle than on iPad,2,2
The item for my son is 4 years old he really likes it it's a good buy,2,2

I bought 5 last year and 2 more this year for gifts. They are simple to use and the youngest can even do it himself (5YO). Get the Kindle free time for the kids. You can set the amount of time they can play games and then they can only read books. Great for the whole family!,2,2

"Great item, fun for the whole family. Great way to save money",2,2
Am very happy with my kindle fire. Many options. Books that I had read on my kindle transferred over without any issues.,2,2
"I got the Amazon Echo for my Parents. Since my Dad often ask us to look up things on our cell phones, I thought Alexa would be a great substitute in our absence. I love the easy setup and sound quality. My Dad is still learning how to navigate and at times gets frustrated with Alexa not having a response to his many questions. However keeping up with grocery list and Dr Appts are great for them. Amazon records what you ask which seems to pierce ones privacy. I'm sure it's for programming purposes since it's ever evolving, but beware what you ask Alexa because she'll remember.",2,2
"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!",2,2
My only wish is I would be more computer litterate. I have trouble understanding what to do next to continue so I go back to start of games. I bought for the Kindle and reading apps. but have put netflix on it,2,1

Not to mention the AC wireless receiver and option to plug in usb devices and sd cards. I would highly recommend this device for anyone",2,2
I liked it. Would be better if battery lasts longer. Great if you use Amazon or shop a lot there. I still love my iPad but Apple rips the wallet. I loved this tablet.,2,2
I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.,2,2
"The echo is the first thing my husband and I listen to every morning, so easy to use.",2,2
What can I say my wife thought it was silly now when I come home from work almost every night she is listening to I hate country music.p.s. I love to control the lights with alexa.,2,2
I would recommend this to anyone it quite compact and easy to use and it good for any age.,1,2
"Didn't compare to the fire stick, unknown if better product, but love amazons creation",2,2

Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!,2,2
Alexa makes it super easy to hear our favorite songs simply by asking! No need to sort through long play lists looking for what we want.,2,2
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;,2,2

"This is the perfect tablet for a toddler. I feel like there is stuff for him to now, but he can also grow with it. And it's built like a tank.",2,2
We bought one for one of my kids for their birthday and his brother liked it so much that he bought himself one with his birthday money.,2,2
This is a good tablet for beginners and older people.,2,2
"I really love my Fire Stick, it has been a great entertainment device",2,2
"I needed to buy an affordable tablet, just right!!",2,2
Great tablet for the price. Good size and great value.,2,2
Compared to the rest this is amazing especially the price.,2,2
The fire is one of the easiest E readers/tablets to use. The Amazon interface makes it a true treasure.,2,2

Amazon Alexa is amazing. Does more then I imagined. Easy to install and quick to learn how to use. Alexa is used each and everyday.,2,2
"It's 2017 and I was wondering to myself if I should jump on board and get a Kindle paper white. Now and days, people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablets. The thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle books through my iPad. After much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision I've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain. This is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use. Battery life is amazing and only charge once every two weeks. If you are just looking for a plain ereader, then this gem is your best bet.",2,2
"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows",2,2
Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.,2,2
Can't beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display.,2,2
Tablet was ok when it worked. Seemed to always have to reset our Wi-Fi at home for this one item. Everything else worked fine.,0,0
"Being a busy mom, I am always looking for shortcuts. This one takes the cake! I use it for everything....checking the time, setting my morning alarm, adding items to my shopping list then being able to check them at the store from my phone....fabulous!!! Not to mention all the funny stuff she does!",2,2
Purchased to have portable Alexa. Nice tablet for the money and recommend it.,2,2
Great for when I'm on the road and I can plug it in to use at any hotel I stay at. Easily understood and versatile to use.,2,2
These are perfect for kids to use and have some nice features for only 50 bucks. I recommend.,1,2
Cool asking it questions and getting accurate replies !,2,2
"Great product! The FireTV is very easy to use but requires the user to setup an Amazon account. This can be a free or prime account. The FireTV easily connects to your Wifi giving you access to Addons, games, music, movies etc. The voice controlled remote control makes searching for your favorite content easy but if you prefer, you can use the navigation features instead. Parental controls are provided if needed. There is also a video you can watch that shows a sample of the features this devise offers. Great purchase. I even took camping using my phone as a hot spot powered by a generator. The FireTV worked perfectly.",2,2
"I purchased this tablet thinking it will fill a void when my previous tablet was stolen, and it has done much more than i expected for it has apps no play store has, and amazon keeps me posted on any updated apps available for download through my email. I could not have purchased a better device for the price.",2,0
Bought for my mother to review pictures and play game. She is enjoying it since games can be played without Wi-Fi.,2,2
Love the voice control and functions. Need to download more apps. Want to purchase the lights to go with it. Never talks back to you.,2,2
"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",2,2
Great for kids. Easy to use. Great price. Would recommend.,2,2
This is a great streaming box. It's is more than I expected.,2,2
"I like this product,. Alexa is a good listener and provides me the information instantly.IT is always a joy and funny when you ask a out of the world question and get a pretty accurate response.",2,2
Great price for a great tablet. I would give it a thumbs up!,2,2
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.,2,2
I bought these as Christmas presents for my grandparents and they love them!,2,2
.great for small children.. Easy to set up and use,2,2
I like the fun we have with it but I wish it was a better quality speaker system for music.,2,2
Excellent way faster stream you pay for what you get,2,2

I would recommend this streaming box. This is one of those things that everyone should own.,2,2
Very good tablet for very little money. Kids love it and it is very durable.,2,2
This was very easy to set up and user friendly. A+,2,2
"Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product.",2,2
I like the size of this Kindle device. The battery lasts a very long time and charges quickly. Haven't found anything not to like about the Kindle Paperwhite.,2,2

For the cheaper price I really liked this tablet. We bought 2,2,2

"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around.",2,2
"I just want a small tablet to check news, weather etc from time to time, and this product works well for that purpose. It is not as fast on my iPad2 but it is a good choice considering the price.",2,2
"I wasn't sure how much I'd use the echo but I found that I use it for music, checking the weather and even cooking tips.",2,2
I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it! The picture quality & the non-glare is his favorite.,2,2
"It is awesome to be able to address ""Alexa"" and ask her to do things like play a song or turn on the lights while my hands are wet or I am busy.",2,2
I started our with just the Fire Stick at home. Once I purchased a 4k TV I decided to splurge on the Fire TV. I'm so glad I did the one thing that annoyed me about the stick was relying on WiFi stability and now I've ran an ether net straight to my router so problem solved.,2,1
"Light weight, easy to use and stays charged much longer than my previous one. Paper white is easier to read in low light too.",2,2
I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.,2,2
"Wonderful tablet to use while traveling or at home. Great for books, movies, and music. For the price, it can't be beat!",2,2
Excellent value great apps and movies. the price was perfect.,2,2
What else can I say? This is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether.,2,2
"I love my Amazon box!! It's easy to use and with the right internet connection, there's no buffing or waiting for movies to download. I compared it to the Apple TV & for the overall money, this was the better purchase.",2,2
"My wife uses for watching movies, reading, Pandora etc...honestly does everything her more expensive tablets did.",2,2
The echo is amazing! I highly recommend this product!!!,2,2
I bought this for my two-year-old son to play games on so I wouldn't panic if he dropped it. It is also a great tool for you fire apps and Amazon Apps.,2,2
"Amazon Fire way surpassed my expectations. I have an IPad but wanted something smaller to read my emails and view videos while I was at work.I'm also able to view excel spreadsheet, without having to purchase another program. Battery has decent power too.",2,2
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,1,2
I am really enjoying my Amazon Echo!! It was very easy to set up and very easy to use (you just have to remember to say Alexa first). Showed it to my sister-in-law while she was visiting and now she wants to order one.,2,2
I purchased this tablet for a need family for christmas.I know they really enjoyed it,2,2
"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media.",2,2
"Good performance for most apps. However, I primarily purchased it to watch PS Vue, and although the PS Vue app is better than on Roku, it suffers from more lag and glitches than watching PS Vue via PS4 or PS3.",1,2
"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though",1,2
"Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features.",2,2
"I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input.",2,2
I have no use for cable because I have everything I could ever need in the fire tv.,2,2
This item is a waste of money as none of the content is 4K. Buy the much cheaper Fire TV Stick instead.,1,2
Simple tablet for beginners. Has everything you neef.,2,2
I'm so happy with my Kindle! It's so easy to order books and it works great to read at the gym.,2,2
I've come from using a Roku and also a Nexus Player and this Amazon Fire TV blows the doors off of them. I do like the newer Roku 4 but you can't beat the price and features that this one has. I definitely recommend this one.,2,2
I love my Amazon Fire TV box. It is so quick and I have access to so many Apps and programs. I recommend it to everyone.,2,2
"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality",0,2
Great stuff for reading. I have been taking it everywhere with me. Reading is never more simple!,2,2
Very good value for money. You will not be disappointed if you choose the Fire tv.,2,2
"Since the Fire TV stick was announced, I've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my TV doesn't do already The answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it Amazon Fire TV Stick is an excellent purchase if:-Your TV is not a smart TV. Meaning your TV or dvd player did not come pre-loaded with apps such as Netflix, Youtube, Pandora etc...-Your TV is a smart TV, but apps do not perform well. Some smart TVs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc...-You want to access Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, and other such apps on your TV-You are an Amazon Prime Member and want to access your Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Photo accounts-You want to participate in casual gaming on your television.-You want to listen to music on your TV-You want to have portability. In other words, Television access to the above services while you are travelling. (Amazon says the capability to use in hotels/dorms etc... with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soon)So, the bottom line is that the Fire TV Stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. If your TV already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.So, how easy is it to use I'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.Read more",2,0
This was a present for my mother in law who is 70 for Mother's Day and she loves it and I was worried she might not. Now I'm going to probably get one for myself!!,2,2
It is very good. I like it. I will buy more items on bestbuy.com.,2,2
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.,2,2
I bought this as a gift for a girl in the second grade. She maneuvers around on it really good.,2,2
My daughter loves this and uses it for her every day reminders and questions,2,2
I received the echo from my husband for Mother's Day. It is very helpful to me. Nice to know the weather before I get dressed in the morning.,2,2
It's fun having Alexa. It's hard to utilize it for all that it can do but if you take the time to learn it's a really helpful household tool.,2,2
Purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day. Wasn't sure what we would do with it but we're finding things. She takes it everywhere with her. Sometimes we put it where we're sleeping and have it play thunderstorm sounds while we're going to sleep.,2,2
This this my 4th one purchased! My granddaughter is in kindergarten and its a good learning tool!,2,2
"Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips",2,2
It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!,2,2
I love playing classic rock and that plays it great.,2,2
I can read it no matter how sunny it is outside. I have a kindle fire for inside and paperwhite for outside.,2,2
"I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.",2,0
"Totally love this product, definitely makes time pass by faster and can take it anywhere",2,2
Only reason I was not able to rate this five of five is that the app 3m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well.,2,0
I purchased this for my father. He likes to watch movies and this was the best way for me to send him movies because he Ives out of town. Great product!!!,2,2
I have 2 of these one for each one of my kids I love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive I chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one,2,2
This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend,2,2
"Using Alexa for mostly music but also for weather, tides and research. Love not having to make up my own playlist. I can just ask her to play a musician I think of any given day. Very spontaneous!",2,2
"With the Amazon player, you don't need satellite TV. Saves you lots of money from cable or satellite companies.",2,2
Prefect for all reading conditions and environments. I take it everywhere.,2,2
This was a great buy. I read all the time and just got tired of carrying multiple hooks with me on flights. So this played a big role in packing,2,2
Very good tablet and it works very well. Easy to use.,2,2
"It was a breeze to set up, a life changer in some aspects from being control lights, temperature, music via voice commands..",2,2
Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy,2,2
I bought it for my Dad to play games and to download books on it so he won't drain his phone battery.,2,2
It's very fast and it's very well made I really like the style of the box it's not bulky like the other boxes out there,2,2
"This is my second Amazon Fire TV, I got the second one with voice remote, but I don't seem to use the voice remote option that often, but I do like the Fire TV and use it frequently.",2,2
Great gift however I wish it was 16G. It was way the angel tree child wanted so thats what she got. Works great and screen is clear.,2,2
Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time,2,2
I use to control my smart devices in the home and listen to music. my kids also use to help them with their home work.,2,2
This product is a great product as long as the plug-in charge port doesn't break and quit taking a charge.,0,2
I bought tablets for my grandson's and they are perfect! I pre-loaded it with games and videos for kids their age (3 and 4) before giving it to them for Christmas. Well worth the money.,2,2
"I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet.",2,2
I love it and my two year old loves it to I love that it has parental locks on it,2,2
This is a good starter. As the company provides more devices that it can control it will become excellent. It's very limited at this time.,1,2
This item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or Amazon music account. Once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone. Pointless!!! More than half the questions I ask her she doesn't know the answers to. The only thing she's good for so far is the time and weather. That basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock I have ever purchased. I want my money back,0,0
Gave one to my mother. Easy to use and lots of applications.,2,2
"Nice display, convenient size, lots of apps and books.",2,2
"Siri at home - it is great when hooked up to lighting, music, etc.",2,2
My daughter was very happy she got for her birthday right away put it to work,2,2
Easy to use and get started with. Have had no issues at all and would recommend.,2,2
Bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she has a blast on it. Be sure to get the kid proof case too. Got to protect your investment.,2,2
seriously.... it's great and you should have one!!,2,2
"Works great, I love it, best streaming box I've ever had.",2,2
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",0,2
I bought this for a young kid so that she would be able to have her own device to play games on. She's been extremely happy and we haven't encountered any issues or problems with her being able to use it.,2,2
This is my third Amazon Kindle and by far it is the best one. The adaptive lighting really helps as it is easy on the eyes. The battery lasts for weeks on a normal charge and charges to full pretty fast.I still enjoy the eink displays over a regular phone or tablet for extended reading periods.The kindle voyage is light weight and I was able to easily find cases and accessories online.I highly recommend the kindle voyage over the other kindle readers because of the advanced features.,2,2
Replaced original paper white with this new model and the recipient just loves it!!,2,2
"Nice for my hubby, he can watch Netflix and use it for the shows he watches.",2,2
"If you don't mind the slow performance, it is a good tablet for the price.",1,2
This is a lot of fun. Also very convenient since it is hands free.,2,2
"The fire box is very well made works great with amazon prime video and kodi. the only complaint i have is the remote doesn't have a on or off button,you have to buy a separate attachment for that.",2,2
Nice sounding speaker and by adding my Apps I can listen to my music,2,2
"This wasn't for me, but for a family member (I have a Kindle Fire HDX for self). They very much appreciate having this as a replacement for another tablet, seems to work better (less/no crashes, better battery) compared to the older one (not an amazon tablet). Side-loaded texture/next-issue as a way to get unlimited magazines (can access subscription on several devices) on this, and it works fine (usually, but once had to clear app data).This tablet is not as high-res as the HDX (so tiny text isn't as clear as it could be without zooming) but it's more than sharp enough for daily use, especially at this price range",2,2
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.,2,2
Highly Satisfied with the product. Great price and performance,2,2
Works great as an ereader. Can hold so many books!,2,2
"Now that we have begun to figure out how to use this, we are liking it much better. It didn't want to work well for us. When I called Amazon's help line, the person told me I couldn't get Amazon music if I was only Prime member. I had to get the premium package. I called again and got a more knowledgeable person and got it straightened out. At times Alexa has trouble getting things right. Learning curve.",2,2
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it,2,2
This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery,2,2
It is not an out of the world product but for the price point it is what it is said to be . It does what it advertises nothing more or lessA little slower compared to Samsung Tabs or Ipads but again less then$35 on blackfriday cant complain,2,0
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO WHEN HE VISITS COUSINS WHO HAVE TABLETS. ITS NOT A TABLET BUT HE HAS NO COMPLAINTS,2,0
I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great,2,2
Bought the fire tv box because the stick was a bit slow and hardly had any space. The box works great and i don't have any streaming issues.,2,2
We picked these up to help people register to vote at events. They have proven to be durable with a respectable battery life and enough compute power to do the work without lag and annoyance. The size is perfect for voter registration drives or other community out reach.,2,2
"I purchase my Alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with its operation. Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do. My future plan is to interface Alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice control. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend Alexia to anyone.",2,2
We already have an echo dot and pleased with it.Bought this on sale at Best Buy because we want a little better speaker which this model offers. Very pleased with sound and easy of adding it to my system,2,2
Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it,2,2
It is very kid friendly. It was very easy to use at home.,2,2
"Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn't sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get's her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture.",2,2
"Generally Alexa is spot on when asked a question. Whether it's the weather, the time, my upcoming calendar events or most music. However, when asked to play classic oldies, I will usually get old country music. When asked about an actor in a tv series, she doesn't know the answer, even though I can find the answer on google. My grand kids love it for the corny jokes they get.",2,2
What a buy. You can now get rid of cable and by this wonderful media streamer by Amazon. Very powerful and responsive.,2,2
"I enjoy this tablet, I find myself using it more than my laptop",2,2
Tv look good in my room so I kind see videos thats good for me! !,2,2
This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.,2,2
"At first when my husband bought this, I fought more electronics to learn. I now love using it especially when I am cooking and I can saw Echo, add cinnamon to grocery list. I also have many cam lighting that I can only say turn on couch one or two or fireplace light and not light up all 9 cams. The say play music is great. It also tells jokes and the recent news or weather. we now have echoes on two levels of the house.But don't worry, he will add some to level 3 soon lol",2,2
"I use this device for watching movies and TV shows. I will suggest install MX PLAYER for MP4,MKV,ETC videos. It is a nice device for beginners.",2,2
"Unfortunately, the first time I plugged the Tablet in to charge it up, the battery overheated and shorted out the tablet. I returned it to Best Buy for a full refund with no hassles.",0,0
The usablity wise good but install the Google store is messy,1,2
My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.,2,2
Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.,2,2
This thing is awesome!!! Its very easy to setup and fun to use. The speaker sounds amazing and the microphone is incredible. I wish my siri could understand me as clearly and accurately as Alexa does. I can't wait to expand my whole house automation!,2,2
I Bought alexa for my children and find myself using it more.,2,2
It's worth it for the shopping and todo lists alone. Great product.,2,2
My kids are loving their kindles and they are easy for them and for me to manage,2,2
"Still getting to know how to use, but so far I am loving it",2,2
Enjoy the small device as well the many features it offers. Will have to get use to the remote but otherwise okay. Price arrange also okay by it being an Apple's product.,2,2
"The unit works well. The camera is not super High Resolution, but it is great to have front and rear cams. Access to lots of apps and email. It's nice to have the extra tablet around the house, and for $35?Child, please. Even at $50, it is a solid value.",2,2
Works well and great for travel. Small and portable,2,2
Love this tablet. Great for social games and videos. Cant beat the price,2,2

Loved the item..great for my autistic stepson.he was very happy.,2,2
"Device is easy to install and user friendly. Best media streaming in my opinion, a must buy.",2,2
"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my grandson who loves it. He can download books to read and play games as well. He carries it with him wherever he goes. Has really enjoyed having his own tablet.,2,2
"I have an iPad mini but it's impossible to see in the sun. I started thinking about getting a kindle while on vacation and trying to read a book at the pool. Damp hands,wrinkled pages - sunscreen all made the experience icky. I live the size, battery power, ease of use and you can see it outside.",2,2
Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.,2,2
"The amazon echo is a great product. We got it when it was on sale and liked how new features are constantly added. We use it often for weather, news, turning on our lights, setting multiple cooking timers and more. It quickly became something we use daily.",2,2

Good product. Love how light and sleek it is. Will recommend.,2,2
Works well for the intended purpose. Easy to download the app I required for additional viewing.,2,2

"This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. I've been using it for a couple of months on weekends, and haven't yet needed to charge it since the first time after buying it.The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.",2,2
Best electronic reader. The base kindle is hard to read because the lack of light and the other readers and apps just don't offer the quality experience and feel of the kindle paperwhite.,2,2
works as expected no issues and I am good with prodcut,2,2
I was buying tablets for two grandkids ages 5 and 10. These did the trick and I didn't have to spend a fortune. I also bought the protective cases to protect them...Great purchase!,2,2

It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons,2,2
So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good,2,2
if you don't already have a smart tv -this is the way to go - Amazon has so many more choices than Netflix plus Prime gets you free shipping on top of free movies,2,2
Amazon Echo is the best thing you do not know you need. It is nice to have Prime along with it. The speaker fills the house with nice sets on request. Go get one. And you will soon find you want one in other rooms. Dots do nice here.,2,2
"I have had a Kindle since the very first generation, and they have come along way since then. This version is pretty handy, reads well, and navigates okay for kindle . It there was any drawback I would say that the store shopping experience thru the actual kindle needs improvement . It's still very antiquated, and seems antiquated compared to today's browsing market.",2,2
This product is a godsend! Helps me stay organized with my to-do list! Keeps me out of the rain by providing weather alerts! It's allowing me to work on my dance moves by playing all the tunes! LOVE IT!,2,2

Everything you need with this little box. Get yours today!,2,2

"I love my Amazon fire tv!! Use it with Playstation Vue, perfect device to cut the cord!!",2,2
"When Best Buy put it on their Deal of the Day, I jumped on it. It does so much and is very easy to set up and use. I've had it for 2 months and I'm still exploring all of the things it does. It just keeps getting better and better every week... Just go to your Alexa app, on your phone or tablet and see what's new this week.",2,2
"This is way to complicated for kids, my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out",0,2
This box provides a wonderful image on my 4K Samsung TV. The program content is extraordinary. You can install whatever apps your heart desires and see virtually the world.,2,2
"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload.",2,2
a lot of the times Alexa will come back and say I don't understand the question get very annoying,1,2
"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!",2,2

I bought this for my 4 year old she loves it never outs if down,2,2
This is the second Kindle Paperwhite we have purchased for one of our Grand Children. This is a great tool to promote reading for kids or adults. This tool combined with Amazon's available online subscriptions or purchasing books individually is the way to go.,2,2
"I bought this for my daughter who is in college. She likes it and carries it many places, even hiking. She says it works very well for her.",2,2
"This was a replacement unit for a first generation unit. It works perfectly, the old unit would not hold a charge.",2,2
Happy with device. It works as advertise. Can not stop using it.,2,2

Love the Kindle! Will allow me to travel with my favorite books all in one place,2,2

I love it. Good Camera and perfect for surfing the web.,2,2
This is one of the greatest things I've ever bought,2,2
Good tablet for basic used. Just need it for basic functions. Perfect,2,2
This was a gift but I also own an Echo of my own that I have had for over a year. I use it daily and would not be with out it. They are always adding more thing that it can do and it has almost become a member of the family.,2,2
Setup was extremely easy. Easy for grandchild to use. Only difficulty is with parental controls stopping connection with library.,2,2
I bought this for my parents to be more connected into Facebook messenger (they don't have phones) and video calling. It's been easy for them to use and learn -- though I highly recommend a keyboard case. I bring it out to read news sites in their new tablet formats. Small but useful. An amazing product given the price.,2,2
Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it,2,2
Still exploring all the things we can do with it. I enjoy listening to radio on it.,2,2
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.,2,2
Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend,2,2
"The Paperwhite was what I expected. It's easy to set up an account, and I can use it outdoors in the sun. Sadly, downloading library books is not as user friendly as I had hoped, but Amazon is in the business of selling books, not lending them.",2,2
what an amazing device. super fast in comparison to the fire tv stick. best streaming device available in my opinion!,2,2
Cool tab. Must buy for kids. Amazon need load apps,2,2
"I mostly use the Echo for home automation tasks, like controlling my thermostat and my Harmony remote control. Still new to it - learning how I can use it to assist with shopping and to-do lists. Love the fact I can change my default music service to Spotify and have it stream music wherever I want. If you're into automation, get the Echo!",2,2
My son's love there tablet. Great but for the price,2,2
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.,2,2
Picked this item up while on sale to control all my NEST & phillips hue lights. Has a much better voice recognition than SIRI,2,2
I purchased this for Christmas.it was easy to set up and am now looking to purchase more for the other rooms.,2,2
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.,2,2
A must for someone who loves to read. Great to carry arounnd!,2,2
Information and music and all you have to do is ask! Alexa is amazing!,2,2
"We debated on getting this because we already have an xbox one for streaming. However, this device streams seamlessly. The remote makes finding shows simple.",2,2
"Still learning the things Alexa can do, but so far, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my husband and son and both have not had any issues with it. Easy to use. Great over all.,2,2
Great gift for my nieceShe is using it every day,2,2

Absolutely love my Kindle.. it is small enough to fit in a pocketbook or small bad. Love taking it with me to the pool or beach. the paper white make reading so much easier .. Highly recommend,2,2
Still getting more and more abilities loaded onto system.,2,2
so if purchasing three more of these after the initial one doesn't say GET ONE I don't know what else to say. rated a 4 not 5 because of sketchy voice recognition sometimes.,2,0
"Brought my old tablet in to my local store, and when they said that I would need to replace iit, they suggested this tablet. I love this tablet as much as my firsdt one! Easy to set up and use, plus the price was reasonable. :)",2,2
One of the best purchases I have bought. I love this speaker and all the things it can do,2,2
"Perfect size, great in all lighting situations. Easy to hold, handle and transport. Makes reading even better!",2,2
This is so much better than the fire stick. No lag and an Ethernet port.,2,2
"Amazon is obviously banking on this item and the Amazon Sticks. In all fairness it is a great product with a lot to offer and a good price point. I like the Voice control feature to easily navigate through your favorite shows, movies and all. I also have a smart home and like the flexibility to control every inch of it from my TV remote too (control lights, doors, Electronics, you name it). You can also do a little programming and installed Kodi to have free movies and such, Yes I said FREE, anyways it is a great product.",2,2
Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.,2,2
Best investment made. I use this daily for reading and doing light work.,2,2

I have cancelled Direct TV and I am using this plaform for personal entertainment.......love it and love the fact that I don't have one those big DirectTV DVR monstrosties sitting in front of my TV anymore which I was paying a monthly fee for. Love Amazon Prime platform there is so much free content available if your a Prime member. I choose this over apple TV because apple charges for everything and can get expensive like Direct TV.,2,2
There is no difference in reading from a book and a Kindle.,2,2
For the price this is a great little tablet. Its fairly fast and fits my needs.,2,2
The kindle is the best ebook reader. I love it and use it daily.,2,2
I like this Kindle its small size is what I was looking for and I enjoy playing games on it!,2,2
Way better than the amazon stick. I use it for kodi,2,2
My home has a lot of wifi product for example light switch and lifx bulbs and nest thermostat. Amazon echo was the last the to make it work all together. Alexa makes it easier and fun to connect your home,2,2
"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value.",2,2
"When connected to SmartThings, Alexa works great. Alexa will hear you from rooms away. The only changes I would make are:1) Make it portable2) Better speaker quality3) Alexa app needs improvement",2,2
I find more ways to use Echo each and every day. From home automation to streaming music.,2,2
"This is such a great product, to listen to music, get the latest news, look up information on the web and get jokes of the day!",2,2
It is easy to operate and happy with Amazon Fire. I wasn't sure how it was going to work but very satisfied of my purchased.,2,2
got it for my three year old and it's perfect for him,2,2
"News, weather and music. That is pretty much all we use it for. If you have Amazon Prime it's nice to just request certain music to play. Sound is ok, not terrible, not great.",1,2
It's so much better than her viewing on her tiny phone. Great price too.,2,2
Great to read with during the day and night. Easy to carry.,2,2
"This is my second Echo. If you are NOT into home automation, the speaker is worth the price just as a speaker. However, if you have an amazon Prime membership, the Echo really shines with access to prime music and other Amazon services. It is also a good way to start into home automation. I personally have the wink Hub and Relays; Alexa (Echos Siri) integrates perfectly with Wink and IFTTT. I am placing Echos in rooms where I want Wireless music and the dots in the rest of the rooms to control my Smart devices from anywhere in the house.",2,2
We really enjoy it. Bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found tons of extra content that we really enjoy,2,2
"I bought this has a gift for my kids. They love their Amazon Fires. A few down sides with the internal memory and speakers. Pretty weak in these areas. The memory and speakers definitely could use some upgrading. Fortunately the device has a slot for memory cards and we can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. To get the maximum use of the device you need Amazon Prime. Compared to Netflix, Prime is very competitive.",2,2
I recommanded this product to specially highschool student.It is good touch screen and good functionality.,2,2
"Gave as gift works good so far, others have one and have enjoyed",2,2
Alexa has become an integral family member. Love her!,2,2
Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!,2,2
"I got this for my kids and I am able to have parental control over all of them, put a time limit on play time, they each have their own apps, games and books that are appropriate for their age. My kids love it and they are learning! With this kids edition I get 1 free year of all kids appropriate app,games,videos and books!",2,2
I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It's almost as good as I IPad.,2,2
Excellent improvement over my first kindle which was the original. Love the backlight for reading at night.,2,2
Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.,2,2
This is my 3rd Echo. One on each floor of our house. Works great and has so many features. Everyone here loves it.,2,2
I'm happy with the purchase. Had to buy additional memory but satisfied.,2,2
So what they have adds. My wife got it for $50 and I know on Black Friday it was $35. Where else are you going to find a color screen for that price. It works well and couldn't be happier.,2,2
"I've had my tablets since last year and they still in great condition, ii read on it a lot so I think I made a good choice",2,2
Great item easy to use and setup fast and great for surfing the web yes I would recommend,2,2
Easy to use and can put parental blocks on it so that the kids don't get into what they shouldn't.,2,2
This device is for me the best streaming device out there.,2,2
Just what my 10 year old needed to take her tech to the next level. Love the parental controls to keep her safe online,2,2
Everyone should have one. Awesome!! Just ask Alexa any question and she will give you the answer.,2,2
Very compact and functional. I especially like the screen color choices in the Kindle Reader.,2,2
"Cool new product, and it makes everything so much easier to just say what I want and have Alexa find it for me.",2,2
"I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it.",2,2
I like the 2 way camera. Took a while to get used to it. I had a very old Kindle so this is way better.,2,2
"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device.",2,2
My wife loves this Kindle. The only complaint is the charging port has been a problem. We ended up exchanging it for a new one after a week or so because the port was loose and it was very hard to charge it. The second one has been much better but there has been a couple of times the charging port has given us issues.,2,2
It's the Amazon Echo. Does what it says and gets you in touch with Alexa hands-free.Works good and awesome for the smart home person.,2,2
Love Echo for streaming music and trivia and weather reports. Very entertaining,2,2
This is a nice small tablet. Works well and great with Amazon products. A great price.,2,2
"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps",0,2
"Bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. Great investment",2,2
"It took me a while to break down and finally buy a digital book, I'm a big fan of paper books. I love the Kindle so far! I wanted an eReader that I could only read books on, no apps or games, that's what my phone is for, and so far I am very happy :)",2,2
I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.,2,2
You could pay more and get something better but for reading comics and watching YouTube this is fine,2,2
I bought this for my seven year old. Last year was an iPad and lasted 3 months. I couldn't see spending $300 on another so I settled for this kindle. She loves it and I'd recommend it as a great tablet for the younger kids and at a great price.,2,2
Brought it as a Christmas gift and then I fell in love with it after setting it up. small and simple.,2,2
You can't beat it for the money. Really cool tablet !,2,2
"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",2,2
"It takes some time to understand all the possibilities with the Echo, but it does really cool stuff. I'd add the sound quality is much better than I had expected as well.",2,2
This really helped me use my echo more- having 2 plugs helps make moving it to another room easier.,2,2
"I bought the Kindle Paper White for travel, its so much lighter than bulky books and can fit in your hand luggage/pocket to read while travelling. So easy to use no screen glare like tablets have so you can read it anywhere. Has adjustable screen brightness and font size too.Has the technology to allow you to order and download books from anywhere you happen to be. I love it so much I bought my sister one too!",2,2
I purchased 2 regular amazon fire sticks around $50 each they would turn off in the middle of shows/movies and weren't working properly I had several issues with them so I decided to give this model a go and it's been worth it so far no issues.. worth the extra $$ it's reliable.,2,0
Easy to set up and use. My entire family loves to ask Alexa questions. Speaker is great.,2,2
"I dont own this, first off. But 1 amp wont charge anything very quickly, and I only write this review because they advertised it on my Fire. The price is 19.99 as of this advert, and thats way out of line for a 1 amp charger.",0,0
"The Kindle is easy to use, has a bright back light and travels conveniently in a coat pocket.",2,2
Bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!,2,2
Great device fast and big enough to see and easy to use !!!!,2,2
Great way to start kids onto using a device with technology,2,2
Very good item. Works well for child. easy to use.,2,2
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.,2,2
I think k this is an awesome product it was very affordable and so far does absolutely everything that I need it to do and it is very user friendly easy to use I'm still getting to know this product but I have no complaints so far,2,2
This is a great tablet for the money. Able to do everything a higher priced tablet does,2,2
"I bought this as a surprise for my fiance, he loves it! It has quickly become a standard part of our daily routines.",2,2
We love Alexa she is fun and informative. I would get this as a gift for a friend.,2,2
This is a fantastic tablet and only cost $35. Can't beat it. It has ads but they're not obnoxious. Would definitely recommend it.,2,2
"the new kindle fires are amazingly good, the only thing that I have to say is the battery life is bad in it. other than that it is well worth it.",2,2
i did not need this,1,0
I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.,2,2
"Easy hook up. I keep it in the family area, the grandkids ask Alexa questions and play songs. Fun for everyone.",2,2
"We use our Echo to control our interior lighting, as well as to set a timer , playing music, getting the weather, and general information. Oh, and the shopping list is a great feature!",2,2
Alexa integrated work faster then the fire stick I would recommend this device watch my 4K videos,2,2
"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader.",2,2
"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum.",2,2
It is a good cheap tablet. Lacks in performance but acceptable for price,2,2
"I got this as a Christmas gift for a family member. You really can't beat the price of this tablet, especially compared to other tablets in its price range. It blows the Digiland tablets out of the water. It is pretty simple to use, only thing that I don't like is the Amazon app store's selection of apps.",2,2
"Very good item, very happy with it, will buy again",2,2
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .,2,2
Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.,2,2
"I purchased this as a gift (Christmas) for my girlfriend but i gave it to her extra early, it's a very good tablet, got it on black Friday for the price $39.99 she love it. Thanks Best Buy.",2,2
I will use this until it blows up. So nice to touch one button and get anything you want,2,2
"Great product, great replacement for Smart TV. Will recommend.",2,2
"I love this Kindle. It is a replacement for one which was almost 5 years old when the built-in light stopped working. I used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. I will not be without a Kindle. Replacing it was a foregone conclusion but I still read the reviews, just in case. :)",2,2
"I am very pleased with this tablet. It is easily portable, user-friendly and has good battery life",2,2
Good tablet for the price. Works as well as a more expensive model.,2,2
"had a regular kindle and this one is just as light but with a backlight so it helps with night time or train reading (when in tunnels).A lot faster too, as it's newer.",2,2
"Haven't had that much experience with it yet but from what I've done so far, it's been great fun. Love that it can be linked to my home security system. Also, so grateful Geek Squad offers a free class on how to use it. I plan on signing up for that soon!",2,2
"I've hooked it up but just haven't signed up for the service yet, So we'll see.",2,2
received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future,2,2
"Amazon's ""Alexa"" program is surprisingly intuitive (and the microphone can hear me from across the house). This product worked a lot better than I initially expected it to.",2,2
Good and easy to buy this tablet with low price! Worth to buy,2,2
"The fire tablet is user-friendly, a good size, and offers many features. The display quality is good, and i have no complaints with the camera. Using Amazon for shopping or for features associated with Prime is very easy. The only issues I have had with this tablet are that my headphone jack does not provide good sound quality, and there are third-party apps that are not compatible with Fire OS. I'm hoping the app issue will be fixed by developers over time.",2,2
Love it!!! I can watch all my shows on it and save money by cutting off cable!!!,2,2
This is a great tablet. My last tablet was a Nexus (a gift) which did not really impress me. The Fire tablet has everything I need to keep myself entertained when I am on the go or recovering from a busy work week.,2,2
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat.",2,2
I didn't need to review the product because I alread had one. I purchased the kindle for my wife for our anniversary and she loves it. The best part is you can read it outside in the bright sun or inside .We rarely buy paper books anymore!,2,2
It's a great product the sound quality is amazing.. would recommend this to all my friends,2,2
We purchased these for our twin 4 yr olds. These are working out great for them.,2,2
"It's my first e-reader ever, so I am a novice. I like my Kindle which now is a large part of my life the same way printed books have always been. It's very compact, weighs very little, has great features (touchscreen, adjustable brightness, easy to navigate and download books). The battery really lasts a long time as advertised. I just wish public libraries had more books in the Kindle format and better interface for e-books.",2,2
"I thought the tablet would be a little wider, its just too long",1,2
Love it because it is thin and light weight and bigger,2,2
Great control of smart home devices. Pandora sounds great. Love the continuing improvements each week.,2,2
This is my second Echo that I use mostly as a Bluetooth speaker for a PC.Great sound quality for the price.,2,2
The Alexa assistant is more accurate than Siri as well as very responsive.,2,2

I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it.,2,2
Nice price for all you get great product all best buy employees,2,2
I just prefer live TV. When you purchase these don't forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network TV and local news.,0,2
Fits and works with everything!,2,2
"Charges good, sturdy charger, feels like good quality not like the plastic feeling you get from buying from those cheap types of charger.",2,2

This tablet is easy to use and a convenient size for travel.,2,2
I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!,2,2
i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done,2,1
"I bought myself a Kindle at Best Buy and loved it so much that I decided to buy one for my daughter. Great place to buy any electronics. Staff is knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant. I buy all me electronics at Best Buy. They have good deals and price matching.",2,2
I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.,2,2
My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.,2,2

"Bought for my Mom, easy to use, simple and she can load all of her books onto her tablet.",2,2
This is a must buy!!!! Great picture you will enjoy this product,2,2
"It's a wonderful little tablet. Was going to shop around. Saw it first, thought I'd try it. Haven't used the cameras yet. I love the size. It's just what I need. I browse the internet. Shop &play games. Also watch TV programs &much more.",2,2
"i love it just dont waste your money to pay for geek squad to install it, it takes less than 5 min and it basically installs itself",2,2
I bought this as a replacement for my original Kindle Fire I bought 4 years. ago. This has more features and many upgrades for 1/3 of the cost of original Kindle ! The technology we have now days is unbelievable ! Thanks Best Buy for a great product that I can afford !,2,2
"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use.",2,2
I love my amazon fire stick. It goes great with my tv!,2,2
Good entry level reader that is easy to use. The resolution is great for that page turning novel. Has lots of other bonuses too.,2,2
My life with Alexa has improved so much. I could ask Alexa questions that I may have and she responds quickly....I even listen to music and I just wonder what life was before ALEXA!!!!,2,2
Works great. Very good sound. Does so many things.,2,2
Bought this tab for the $40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. Nothing worthy of note though I have to say I am not a fan of the amazons operating system. My wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the home-screen is not OCD friendly.,1,2
this item was cheap and good in use. I had no problems with this item.,2,2
reat product would greatly recommend this to my Freinds,2,2
Easy to set up and use. The remote is sleek and functional,2,2
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.,2,2
"Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere.",2,2
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child,2,2
Love the fire tv. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great quality content and streaming,2,2
Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.,2,2
"Fast for the buck. I would give it a perfect 5 stars but the screen seems to have dead pixel after couple of use, but still great cheap for kids.",2,2
"For someone with extremely weak eyes, Kindle is a savior! I love reading, but reading books is stressful for my eyes, because of the font and not proper lighting all the time. With Kindle, I always have the back light and the I customize the font of each book, so it's much easier on my eyes!",2,2
Got this for my 5 yr old grand child. She loves it,2,2
Purchased for dorm room gift. This compact cylinder packs a lot into one unit. Alexa is our go to resource. Alexa will be your trusted companion. So happy I purchased Amazon Echo.,2,2
I have the Kindle Paperwhite from 2013 and my fiance just got the 2015 version. It's great to see added features without a change in price!,2,2
"I purchased the 7"" and 8"" units at the same time. They are both nice little tablets for using the Amazon apps and cruzing the internet, but the 7"" is lacking the additional 512Mb of ram an 8Gb of storage that make the 8"" worth the additional money.",2,2
This is the best tablet that has ever come on the market for $49!,2,2
"It works, that is all that is necessary of it.",2,2
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.,2,2
Really good for reading and watching movies and playing games.,2,2
Amazon fire was awesome! They are cheap but they work just fine!!! This is my 2nd ones so far great for kids!,2,2
The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.,2,2
Been waiting to get ALEXA for years and not disappointed yet. It has A lot of features already and I like the fact I get weekly email about new features they are still adding.I would rate a five but nothing is perfect.,2,2
Great for reading in both the dark and outside. Perfect for the bookworm in your family.,2,2
So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.,2,2
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product,2,2
The paperwhite feature works great. Can read books in a room with low light,2,2
This was a great purchase. I love the size and functionality.,2,2
Pros: Controls the lights in our house and integrated seamlessly with the wemo app. Plays music well and sounds great as a Bluetooth speaker. We are even able to add groceries via a 3rd party app (OurGroceries).Cons: Some of the commands are a bit of a mouthful and if you don't say the command in the proper order and in a timely manner Alexa will not understand. It would be nice if you could change the default built in lists and to dos to a 3rd party app to make the commands a little easier.Overall: A little expensive for a gadget but the home automation is really fun!,2,2
I already had a Echo but the wife apparently liked it more than me and took it over. I bought a Dot for about $120. Less than the Echo and personally prefer that. The wife decided she wanted another Echo for the basement. They are both great and work well with my Nest thermostat. If you get one you will love it. It takes a little time to figure out the best way to ask things from it so it responds correctly the first time. Bought it on sale for $50. Off.,2,2
"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device.",2,2
Love it this is so much better then paying for cable TV there's so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movies,2,2
Just as advertised. Bought for my mom who has poor eyesight. She loves it. Thank you.,2,2
"This Echo device is great. The sound is awesome, There is so much this thing can do just talk to it it talks back. One thing I have that will listen to me. Just kidding.",2,2
"The Echo is a great bluetooth speaker - fantastic base response. Of course, it gives you Alexa as well - which is sometimes very good - but other times disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this if you pay full price, but when Best Buy has a sale this can be a great deal.",2,2
I bought this as a gift for my moms birthday and she loves it. The screen size is just right and it really fast for the games she plays.,2,2
I'm very happy with my purchase.It arrived on time. Amazing performance.,2,2
"This tablet is great for the price. We ended up purchasing 6 of them. It is great for the kids and is very functional. I think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. Would purchase again.",2,2
Don't like that Amazon has so many ads going on this thing. Makes it pretty not fun to use.,0,2
My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money,2,2
"This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.",2,2
"I love my Alexa.She is smart,convienient and fun.I am still learning new things about her.",2,2
Tablet is very well built for 49.99 . Only issue is the speed of the processor,1,2
"I have bought 2 of these, one for my 4 yr old and one for my 6 yr old. Both of them have previously broken tablets before. I am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform. A super deal for a tablet. I likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my iPad. Just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. I wish there was a restore purchases button like in the Apple Store since I've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear... I'm sure if I were less lazy I could call customer support though :)",2,0
My son has the vacuuming chore. He loves his new toy! It is light and seems to 'walk' itself.,2,2
This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,2,2
Great for kids just learning to use a tablet for the first time.,2,2
I brought this item for my grandson and I know that he will really enjoy it and it was a great price.,2,2
"A nice size with many perks, like a crisp screen & fun vibrant colored outer shell. However the pop up ads are annoying.",1,2
I bought this not knowing if I would like it.LUVIT,2,2
Very convienent and works like a charm! The children enjoy playing games on it too.,2,2
Great value for an awesome gadget. Love it so much,2,2
This is the best gift a reader can receive. Easy to use.,2,2
The only bad thing about Alexa is you have to down load apps for her to do things . She is getting smarter by the day as long as I put the apps in . But she is fun .,2,2
"A good friend of mine got into transforming Fire Sticks and Fire TV two Kodi boxes. He brought over his Fire TV and led us use it and afterwards my wife was convinced that we needed to have one. With Fire TV it makes Kodi stream smoothly and the menus are quick. I love that I can have Netflix, other apps, and other programs installed all on one unit.",2,2
For $49 this tablet is an incredible value!!This is the best solution ever for kids,2,2
"Love it! Ask Alexa and you shall receive! Music, news, local weather! Great!",2,2
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",2,2
Not the best and the brightest in the market. Bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. Best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. Good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.,0,1
Love this fire stick and the ability to display a much crisper and clearer picture,2,2
The kiddos love this tablet! I bought a different brand last year and it lasted less than 2 months. This is still going strong at 5+ months.,2,2
Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.,2,2
"Couldn't wait for my son to open his Kindle Paperwhite. for Christmas. He was thrilled to get it. But, powering it up he found out it was lighter, more versatile and enjoyable to use. One of the best.gifts I've given.",2,2
The paperwhite is so cool. I don't know why I didn't get it sooner.,2,2
Installed easily however little documentation for total setup and individual preferences. Loads of features and uses would be nice if documentation was included with purchase. However how to books can be found in the internet.,2,2
It was a birthday gift for my son. He loves it and I use it from time to time. I would recommend it and the price is nice.,2,2
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles,2,2
"This is an easy to use, inexspensivd tablet for kids. Great for basic tasks and games.",2,2
"I purchased 7 of these tablets on black friday. We have enjoyed them a lot. I was worried about the clarity of games, since they aren't hd. But, they are fantastic. Lots of free books, apps, games. Very happy with my purchase",2,2
"Very nice table, for a very good price. Very good for reading, browsing, and basic functions.A little slow overall. And I also miss some better features related to the different profiles we can create. For example, we can create different profiles for kids, but can't put a password to each one of them (at least, I didn't find how to do it).",2,2
"Easy to use, compact, and great sound. Set up was very easy",2,2
This item works great!Great speaker sound & works great with voice commands .,2,2
great product for entertainment and having all your accounts in one,2,2
Really like this allows me to set reminders and listen to Sirius radio. Easy to set up,2,2
"Love it!!! My amazon prime membership keeps on giving... amazon shopping first, amazon TV next... now now fire tablet.. wow.... free movies and books download... and this tablet can handle it. at lower price point than HD. i was worried about its screen.. but, you know what? it still looks good. i guess when i look at it side by side with my other galaxy tab, i can see the difference. But, when i just watch this, it looks great. I have been watching HD TV for awhile now. So, if it is bad, i will know. this one is still pretty good.",2,2
Took me a few times to get used to it and now I love this Kindle!,2,2
This a great product. I would buy this again for a gift for myself.,2,2
I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!,2,2
"I checked reviews and ratings for the echo for a long while but was still hesitant about purchasing it. I didn't see the value in this product despite all the good reviews and ratings. I was convinced to purchase it at best buy when I saw it and it was out for display, my wife and I immediately started to test it. it was convincing because it was loud in the store but still the echo was crisp and loud. once we took it home we set it up and it was even better with all the features that this comes with. we use many of them. I like how it is built and how much it does. the echo is very helpful and now we are about to buy a couple more for around the house.",2,2
"This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions.",2,2
Purchased for my 75 year old mom so she could adjust the font size and find the books for her book club less expensively,2,2
"Best Home Automation Assistant, Got It For $80 During One Day Sale. Will Recommend",2,2
Cheap but very awesome tablet. It has everything that you need,2,2
"Good product, needs a few more things added on but works very well",2,2
Recommended by staff member when I asked for help. Love the size and ease of use. Just what I was looking for.,2,2
"Overall the Echo is a fun product to own. We typically use it for listening to music, finding out about the weather forecast, or having her tell corny jokes. Eventually we'll start linking it to wifi thermostats, but that hasn't happened yet.",2,2
"These tablets are a great value -- theyre perfect for kids or users who just want to browse the web, read, etc. They are not the most powerful but for the price they're an amazing deal.PS use a search engine and learn how to sideload Android apps. The Amazon store is a bit limited and missing some popular apps. Sideloading removes that problem all together.",2,2
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kids. I set parental controls to prevent internet access. My only issue is that the Amazon App Store doesn't offer the YouTube Kids app. Other than that he's had the the tablet for about 4 mths & we've had no issues.,2,2
"Worth the purchase, makes watching shows easy plug and play",2,2
I use this all the time at home. Usually for radioandpod casts. Alexa usually understands me and does what I ask.,2,2
The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.,2,2
"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!",2,0
Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.,2,2
Crystal clear screen. Easy to use. Reading for day/night excellent!,2,2
The best thing I bought . I kicked My cable provider out and got this. It was he ebay thing I did,2,2
lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light.,2,2
"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet.",2,2
"Replaced my older (lost during recent move) version. Must admit this model is faster, has more storage and a camera! Love it",2,2
"User friendly, affordable, nice features, good battery life",2,2
This product is fun & easy to use. It's good fun for the whole Family. There have been a few issues with connecting nest & hue but once I received the proper guidance it was a breeze.,2,2
In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.,2,2
Great tablet but doesn't hold a charge for a long needs a better battery but overall it's a good tablet,2,2
Highly recommended.Good quality product very good for streaming your favorite shows and movies.,2,2
"I had purchased the fire stick,but then decided to upgrade to the fire TV for more memory space and faster wifi.",2,2
I love this little critter!,2,2
This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.,2,2
"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!",2,2
"Bought the Echo for my hubby's birthday, and it is everything I expected. It is so easy to set up, and we enjoy it so much. We use it to play music (such as a certain genre or artist or particular song). The sound quality is very good. My grandkids love to hear their songs too. We use it to make our shopping list, as it's easy to add things whenever you think of them, and no lists to lose! I definitely would recommend the Amazon Echo.",2,2
Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.,2,2
We love our kindles. They are very sturdy compared to pricier tablets.,2,2
It's good and fast. It does what you want it for. I use it mainly for reading and my son plays a few games on it. Alright product.,1,2
Just plug in and go. Very easy to use right out of the box. Speaker seems to be great quality.,2,2
I love the Kindle Paperwhite!! It allows you to read in any type of situation. You can control how bright or dim the backlight is. You can also turn the backlight off to save battery when you're in a well lit area. It's got plenty of space for hundreds of books.,2,2
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price,2,2
"It works but it takes a while to do anything. But for the price, it's good enough for the kids.",0,2
"It's everything you can ask for in a tablet. The only downfall was the camera, but at a price like that, you get what you pay for.",2,2
"Alexa is my new best friend. I was able to set up the Amazon Echo rather quickly. It was harder to unpack the device than to set it up. I love to listen to the music and play jeopardy. I can even ask Alexa to turn on my lights, you need a smart plug to do this it is an added cost but worth it.",2,2
Amazon fire tv is a great product. It turns any tv into a smart tv. I watch all my movies and tv shows with the fire tv.,2,2
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.,1,0
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................,2,2
"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI.",2,2
"Sometimes you have to be very specific on where to find the information. For example, if Alexa does not know the answer, I have to tell her to look in Wikimedia",1,2
Bought the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet on a BF whim while standing in the checkout line. Glad I did. Nice and compact. Fast. I'm using it daily and finding I can do more with it than I thought I could.,2,2
This item was on sale and I bought it cheaper than on Amazon with the features it's a great buy,2,2
My whole family loves it! We love listening to music. Alexa eill search for so many things on the net :-). We even programmed the cofee machine to turn on qith Alexa!! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I wish it also spoke Spanish.,2,2
"The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place.",2,2
"Alexa is super easy to set up. Works great even if you're not a Amazon Prime member, but if you have Prime the added benefits are awesome! I added this to my echo dot.",2,2
Great purchase. quick speed lots of choices to watch and cheap !,2,2
Home assistant x bluetooth speaker. Alexa is awesome!,2,2
Really good product voice commands work a lot better than expected. Even just using it as a speaker I feel like I got my moneys worth.,2,2
Bought for one of my granddaughters. It was easy for me to get setup and off she went. Kids are too smart these days.,2,2
"This tablet is the perfect size and so easy to use. Read, play games or any other purpose--it is great!",2,2
"Holds a charge, easy to use, all in all great tablet.",2,2
"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on.",2,2
"After visiting my Nephew up in Portland, Or were he introduced the fire stick to me I couldn't wait to get back to Phoenix to purchase one but after talking with the sales clerk I decided to get the Fire TV and enrolled Amazon Prime happy that I did.",2,2
It's perfect for reading and even watching movies. The only thing that is not so great is taking pictures with the tablet. They do not come out as clear as I would like them. But overall perfect for what I use it for. That's mostly reading and watching movies.,2,2
"I am a Flight Attendant and I love this small sleek book!!!! It is a must have. The only thing I would change is, I would add audio",2,2
We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.,2,2
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.,2,2
Very good product at a very good price. I bought this product as an affordable table option for my son.,2,2
This is such a great product! I am learning new things to use my Alexa for each day! The games she plays are fun and I especially like how she connects to all of our smart devices to voice control them! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!,2,2
"Nice interface, easy to use. Smooth, no buffering.",2,2
I bought this for a gift and the receiver loves it. It's so easy to read.,2,2
"great item, if my hands are tied up, I can ask alexa about the weather or sports even songs with out the touch of a button",2,2
I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded,2,2
"My niece loves this tablet. It did not take her very long to learn the apps, how to download apps, visit wifi and etc. Thanks",2,2
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,1,0
I wanted them to have a tablet and after reading the reviews and price of the Amazon Fire; I was very pleased.,2,2
Very happy with it. Set up was fast and easy. Worth the price,2,2
Bought one at the store and liked it so got one for my daughter inlaw for Christmas,2,2
For my son. He loves it. Has it tied into electronics in his room.,2,2
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.,2,2
Great product and great service from bestbuy online,2,2
"Works well when it works...sometimes it seem not to want to ""wake"" up",2,2
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.,2,2
This is a very good starter tablet for anyone wanting to mess with one without breaking the bank. Everything runs and looks great from videos to games to books. Only thing that I feel could push people away is the app store(uses Amazon's). Otherwise this is great.,2,2
"It's been solid so far. Can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from Apple and Google are available on the Amazon App Store. But for the price I think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc.",2,0
Makes life easier. I have several smart home products including nest devices and hue lights. Alexa lets me control them all with my voice. And I don't even have to shout. Even if across the room.,2,2
My son and I love the tablet. Works great! Thanks!,2,2
"It's really amazing to know that when I think of a task, I can ask and it be accomplished. Looking forward to integrating the Echo into my lifestyle.",2,2
I chose this to check email and Facebook because I don't have a smartphone. It's a lot quicker than getting on my laptop. I use it for YouTube and Pandora also. My only complaint is my old eyes struggle with the smaller print. I am pleased with it!,2,2
This is the first time I buy a kindle product. And the price is fairly good since I get the 20 discount! The screen reads like real papers. But the background light I think is not necessary because it will reduce the quality of reading.,2,2
"A kindle is great you can do alot on it reading books, getting on the internet, playing games just like a tablet.",2,2
This product is very easy to use and we are very happy to have it.,2,2
Get one!! She gets smarter every day.. I've had echo for a few months and love it,2,2
This is a great light weight android tablet. It works well for most things that I wanted to use it for. I wanted to see if it would work for board packets but decided that the form factor is too small. As a reader and light weight table it works great. At this price it is a great buy.,2,2
great table for kids and parents control great gre,2,2
I had a 1st gen fire. Battery started getting week after 4 years. Bought this as a replacement. I like the expandable SD slot and the camera. Much better than the first at 20% of the price.,2,2
"We have several Alexa units throughout our home and love the way it will control lights, TV, and Thermostats.",2,2
"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly.",2,2
Love this Kindle paperwhite!! It is easily carried in my purse!!,2,2
"Nice and easy on the eyes, lightweight. What I take on trips to read outside or at home anytime.",2,2
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.,2,2
I have found Alexa (echo) to be indispensable. I use her for my alarm clock. I play music to go to sleep at night using the sleep timer so the music shuts off by itself. And I use the weather skills several times a day. I just love this device.,2,2
"Handy size, easy to read in all situations and we can even send other documents than books to it.",2,2
Purchased for toddler to watch movies and stuff. He loves the apps that are available.,2,2
Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!,2,2
I love tge size of the tablet. I can store it in my bookbag and go about my way.,2,2
She is loving being able to play all the games that we can download. Easy to use and the perfect size.,2,2
Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.,2,2
If you are in doubt about spending the extra money to buy the Voyage... don't be. If it hadn't been a gift I would have most like not spent the money but after using it I am so glad I have this one.,2,0
"flips between Prime, Netflix, and Hulu quickly and easily & lot more",1,2
Watch amazon prime and netflix on it for cheap. What else do you need from a tablet that costs under $50.,2,2
Very fun and informational tool to have. Bought this for my wife but everyone loves it!,2,2
This item is great for me and my family. We recently have started looking for innovative ways to watch television and found this product beneficial!,2,2
"Used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 times--the kindle just won't switch on. Had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. It is clearly defective. Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected.",0,0
"We weren't crazy about the idea of getting another portable electronic device that distracted her from her schoolwork. 5th graders need to read much more than previous years and the Paperwhite not only encourages reading but eliminates the clutter that occurs from many paperbacks. The screen is the perfect size, lighting more than adequate, and the functionality is ideal.",2,2
Amazon fire tab is good for begineers or for kids. Memory and disk gets occupied soon. Suitable for fewer apps.,2,2
$50 for a tablet is amazing. It does what it needs to do with not alot if frills.,2,2
Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.,2,2
Great tablets for everyday use. My child watches his favorite YouTube videos on it.,1,2
"I really enjoy amazon fire tv I get to watch Netflix, amazon prime movies and games. It has a very affordable price for a small box.",2,2
"This is a great product and for the cost, it exceeded my expectations! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to carry their book collection all in one device.",2,2
"I never thought I would make the switch from actual books to electronic media but I don't regret it, not for one minute! With all the free books I have already downloaded I will be reading for a lo-o-o-o-o-o-ong time!! I'm adding new books every day and the options are endless! And....I don't have to have the light on at night to read in bed anymore! Love, love, love my Kindle!",2,2
"Got this for one of my foster kids, he just love it. He cried when he received it. Another satisfied customer. Yea for the Carter home.",2,2
"I love this little tablet, it fits right in my pocketbook without adding a lot of weight. It's easy to use and I can do almost anything on it. I highly recommend it.",2,2
It contains too many adds that cant be removed including the lock screen its not worth the money,0,2
"I love the paperwhite! It took me a long time to get used to an e-reader, but the paperwhite won me over. The battery lasts forever. It has a light so you can read in bed. Font size is adjustable. It's SO lightweight, and it feels good in your hand. Great on your eyes. Easy to use. You can bring all the books you want with you when you travel. I have an android tablet, and an ipad, and I prefer to read the kindle paperwhite. No contest!",2,2
Does everything I need. Can watch movies and read books.,2,2
I haven't used this yet but I knew I wanted one so I don't have to use my computer every time I want to charge my e-reader.,2,2
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.,0,2
"Great product, easy set up, easy to hide but pleasant to look at. Works great but have not found any content that was Dolby digital. Picture is nice",2,2
Perfect size for doing everything!Multiple accountss- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids a.Battery llife is amazing Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great,2,2
Ive always been a fan of mad max and this game surely is satisfying! Pure action at its best!,2,2
Great product for when you are on the go.great sound,2,2
I am studying for my MA and the amount of books that this decree is going to require will be increditable. This alleviates me from having to buy more book cases.,2,2
Not a bad display for the price. AMAZON ads pop up,2,1
Keeps up with my appointments e-mails and all sorts of things I love it !,2,2
I got rid of cable for this and trust and believe it is worth it.,2,2
"I was expecting a tablet good enough for the kids to play and download games, and I was told at BB that this product would work for these basic needs. It seems like everything I download needs to be through my Amazon account, very few items are for free, and everything takes forever to download and/or open. Wish I could return it!",0,2
My son has enjoyed using this to read books and stream the internet. The price was great too!,2,2
"It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo",2,2
"It is okay I guess, but not very user friendly. I probably wouldn't recommend to a friend for this reason",2,0
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet,2,2
This was a gift and they love it so much that I think I will get more,2,2
This is the best of all kindles- affordable and easier to read. The backlight option is good to read in dark.,2,2
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!,2,2
"I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price",2,2
This Product is Unique and does most of my work in home. I love it..,2,2
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around,2,2
We like the Fire better than Roku. We also prefer the ease of use over the funtionality of our new Sony 4K TV.,2,2
Great deal for the cost. Would purchase item again.,2,2
"Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, i use it in place of a speaker and connect my phone to it.",2,2
"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!",1,2
I got 6 of them they didn't have google plus me no like,0,2
This makes for a great house warming present for anyone who loves tech! Definitely want to buy one for myself.,2,2
"No issues. Love this tablet, so glad we bought it.",2,2
Bought for my niece she loves it !! Easy to use and good size.,2,2
"we have enjoyed using this from the day that we purchased it. It is not only useful for everyday, but is a wonderful addition to any party setting.",2,2
"With a 300+ book library, I'm an avid reader. But when you're teaching a 1200-page behemoth, carting it around becomes a bit of a burden. With the Kindle, it weighs almost nothing. Plus with the Paperwhite, I can read when the wife goes to sleep without getting kicked out because of lamplight! Love it",2,2
"Liked it a lot,, Liked it a lot, liked it a lot!!!",0,2
It works really well with my Amazon prime and Nest,2,2
"I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet",2,2
The Amazon - Fire TV is easy to learn and wonderful customer service they will walk you throw any thing you need help with.,2,2
"It's perfect for me, my husband and my daughterthere are so many apps we downloaded, Sling, Nick Jr, Disney, CNN etc.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider ""passes through"" the HBO, Netflix, etc",2,2
I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.,2,2
"One of the best products to have, save so much money on the long run. I use this instead of having cable and it works even better. It's half the cost of one monthly cable bill and I have access to 100x more channels. You will need one amazon tv box per tv unless you don't mind moving it from the living room to the bedroom.",2,2
Easier to navigate to find what your looking for. A lot of selections to choose from,2,2
Great product and price service in the store could have been better,2,2
"Love all things I can do with Alexis, games, info.",2,2
It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.,2,2
Very satisfied. Great coverage. Easy to set up. Never misses motion.,2,2
I cut my cable and move to Playstation Vue. Amazon fire tv boxes are fast and picture quality is amazing. I purchase 4 boxes for the whole house.,2,2
i would and have told people to get one if they have a 4k tv,2,2
Really cool and useful. Kids love it also. Sound quality is good enough considering size and other capabilities.,2,2
"I refuse to buy cable, and I was using my computer to stream shows. This was interfering with my homework. I decided to try the stick out, but due to the upgrades they were out. I bought the box instead. I am so happy with my purchase. It doesn't overheat or get slow or have any of the problems the stock has.",2,0
I love my kindle fire. It is a 16 GB but I change it to 32GB.,2,2
"I enjoy using this, it has a wonderful Ultra HD picture quality. I picked this version for use with Sling TV or Playstation Vue.",2,2
Had the fire TV stick and this is much faster with better picture quality.,2,2
"I bought this tablet for my dad for Christmas and he loved it! I had to show him how to use it (of course), but now he has the hang of it!! Great buy!",2,2
"THOUGHT I GIVE IT TRY,SO FAR IT DOES THE JOB FOR WHAT I NEEDGOOD FOR THE PRICE!",2,0
This was very easy to set up & use. The speaker has great sound.,2,2
Price for the device was a great deal and the assistance provided by employees was great.,2,2
Very good for the price. Would buy it again for sure.,2,2
"Great for using in any condition, specifically outside in the sun. No glare like the iphone and ipad",2,2
"I love Alexa, she has gotten me in trouble from ordering from Amazon but still love the Echo.Every week it seems like she can do more. If you're a Amazon Prime member it's a great device.",2,2
If you don't have high expectations this is a good deal for the price.,2,2
My granddaughter loves it uses it a lot helps with her homework,2,2
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.,2,2
"Very responsive. I purchased the Phillips light bulbs and Alexa controls them, brightness and color. Learning what Alexa can do takes time but well worth the effort.",2,2
"Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long.",2,2
I purchased this device to interface with Lutron lighting system and a harmony hub remote for my entertainment system and I couldn't be happier. Work great!!,2,2
"Great product for home automation, music, news, weather",2,2
it was mainly purchased for reading in dark. it does not irritate eyes when used in night without light,2,2
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",2,2
light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images,2,2
This is a great product. Battery life is very good. Great for reading at night and works great in sun light. Sign up through Amazon and get books cheap or free.,2,2
"Really good, does what is described. Was at good price.",2,2
The Fire TV was purchased for our living room and we primarily use it for watching Playstation Vue and Netflix. We already had a Fire Stick for my daughter's bedroom which we have found to be painfully slow. The Fire TV is a completely different experience - great performance and completely worth the extra money over the Fire Stick.,2,2
"The Amazon Echo is a wonderful addition to my house. I can listen to the music i like, when I want to. I am still learning about all of its other wonderful qualities.",2,2
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!,2,2
I'm very happy with the improvement made to the fire tv. I'll definitely recommend this box to all my friends.,2,2
"This is a great device for those who are looking for time savings throughout the day. I am still learning how to use the Echo, but I have the basics down. You can ask about the weather, news briefings, jokes, play music etc. So far so good.",2,2
"Fun to use, it opens your world to a whole new way of interacting with tech.",2,2
I love it it was a gift for my niece she uses it a lot to extreme movies battery holds up very well,2,2
"This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!",2,2
My son loves the kindle we got for him. It's perfect for the little guys to watch Netflix on.,2,2
Love my Amazon FireTv Stick. Bought one for my whole family.,2,2
I use this while im at work to have a bigger screen to watch my shows on. However I prob dont really need it. It has most apps. Not all games thatbi use on my phone. Its big and nice screen. Resolution is very nive. However i hardly use it besides work. When I'm at home i iust use my phone. I gave it a 4* due to not having all apps or games available. The wifi signal doesnt pick up as well as my phone either.,2,1
So far so good. Having an issue with one of them freezing. Might have to use it,2,2
"Love the shopping list feature, weather report, time, listening to favorite music.",2,2
Amazon is a great product. Use with Prime and get shopping benefits!,2,2
"This is an excellent product, recommend to everyone",2,2
My daughter had been asking for a tablet she loved it and since likes to watch movies and play games and take a bunch of pictures i like that you can expand the memory up to 128 gigs.,2,2
Was bought for my parents who are getting older and this can assist them with lights and everything,2,2
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.",2,2
We have only had our fire stick for a few weeks but we love it so far! There's so many options and the quality is wonderful.,2,2
I am enjoying this product very much. great buy!!!,2,2
Duarable and very handy. Good start for beginners and can add the protective case for kids,2,2
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free,2,2
Very good buy for the money had 2 months and works great,2,2
Not knowing much about the fire tv I did my research and when I got it home it was even better than I expected!,2,2
Echo is the best way to have any songs (over a million) with just one command to Alexa. All the many features make for a wonderful piece of technology enjoyed by all ages. So helpful and entertaining!!!Love it!,2,2
This is a great tablet. It keeps my kid occupied for hours if I need to.,2,2
"It would be nice if it had a text list of books, like my old kindle. The cover graphics are too small to read. This is the only reason for four stars, and not five. Other than that, I like this better because of the great resolution and contrast, as well as the built in LED's for reading at night.",2,2
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality,2,2
This is a great entry-level tablet for someones first tablet.,2,2
Easy to readNo eye strainLong battery lifeSimple to useInterfaces well with computerNot for web browsingVery ergonomicLightweightSturdy,2,2
Convenient reliable product. If you need a product that can give you immediate response to your daily needs this is it!,2,2
This is an amazing product doesn't matter if u buy for a kid or an adult either one will absolutely love it I have 2 !!! Totally recommend it,2,2
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.,2,2
This product is so easy to set up and use. The sound quality is amazing.,2,2
Excellent tablet at an exceptional price. I highly recommend this tablet.,2,2
Great for reading anytime of day. Size is perfect.,2,2
I really wanted this as a Christmas present however it's nothing like the ads. Alexa works sometimes and then not. I can't get her to play music or listen to the radio through her. Very disappointed. Plan on taking it back.,0,2
"This came in handy when our computer had to go to the pc hospital. It was convenient, quick, easy to use!",2,2
It is a very good product with great quality. Good,2,2
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.,2,2
"The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection.",1,2
Very good value for the money. The kids love them! Easy to set up and use.,2,2
I bought this for myself because i play my kindle long periods of time and now i can play while it is charging wouldn't be without it i can sit on my favorite chair and cord still reaches as it did not before.,2,2
"Great price and bargain, especially if you have Amazon prime it works well with it",2,2
"Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again.",2,2
Echo performs well when she understands the question asked. I find myself often repeating questions because Alexa doesn't get it right.,2,2
"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite because my existing Kobo Vox e-reader could not be read in the sun, which I get a lot of in Naples, FL. Excellent e-reader!",2,2
I am purchasing this tablet for my younger cousin as a starter tablet. But we will see how well it holds up with his rigorous activity and game playing.,2,2
"This was purchased as a gift for my son. Now I'm thinking of getting two more, one for me and one for my other son. So need I say more. If I had this in my own home I probably would have given it 5 stars. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't used it first hand",2,2
Best part about this unit is it works with KODI. Easy to setup and use. The remote is small and easy to understand. For the price I would highly recommend this above all the others.,2,2
I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this,2,2
Perfect for what my 8 year old uses this for. Watching programs and playing learning games.,2,2
such big sound from a tiny cylinder . I originally purchased to only listen to music but end up loving the technology and use the Alexa features almost everyday!,2,2
"Smaller than I expected but easy to hold. Very difficult to figure out how to access library, delete books. No user instructions came with it.",2,2
"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!",2,2
"Watching the ads in the beginning, I was skeptical on how useful the Echo would truly be in my life; but once I opened it and spent a little time adding things like ""skills"" (which you find in the app and can enhance Alexa beyond belief), I quickly realized how much I LOVE this device! I have it hooked up with my Harmony remote (a Logitech product) that I purchased from Best Buy, along with any and all other accounts I have, such as Pandora, iHeart Radio, etc., and now I find myself asking Alexa to do almost everything; i.e., ""Alexa, play some _____ (artist) station"", to ""Alexa, turn on my Blu-Ray Player/ TV/ Apple TV/ Radio"". This device I can truly see is the beginning of where home technology is headed.",2,2
"I purchased this simply for reading kindle books. I was able to get it with a reward certificate for $40. It's biggest issue is glare, more so in the sunlight. I bought an anti-glare screen protector and it made a huge difference, but it is still difficult to read in the sun. I'm still very happy with the product.",2,2
This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.,2,2
It's very fast and has great picture and for the price you can't beat it,2,2
"Great streaming device, and at a fantastic price. Forget the fire-stick get the fire-tv",2,2
"I had two kindles previously, I think 3rd gen white one with keyboard, cheapest kindle I won couple years back from a raffle, and finally purchased this paper white. So much easier on my eyes and my wife doesn't get bothered by a little bit of light it produces. I was a casual reader who reads one book every quarter and with paper white I read 1-2 books a month minimum.",2,2
Excelente !!,2,2
"For the price I was skeptical, but this thing can do everything!!",2,2
Cool little device that tells you almost anything you want to know. Music sounds good as well!,2,2
This device is incredible. It can pick up on your voice from across the room and has yet to make a mistake about what I asked.,2,2
"Bought Echo with Alexa and my family loves the entertainment. You ask Alexa and You get music, and answers for almost everything. Best thing of all was the great sale of $90 off price. You get free entertainment at its best. Will recommend for families or for individuals. You won't be disappointed. Amazon created a monster.",2,2
This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.,2,2
"Great product for the price but make sure to purchase a separate SIM card, 8GB fills up fast.",2,2
This is a great purchase. It is easy to use. I will definitely recommend it to other people.,2,2
I purchased this to replace the Ereader I had. It has done that and so much more.,2,2
Excellent for my loving kids and more easily to use by them.,2,2
Just love my new tablet. I have had a kindle fire for 4 years and it was messing up badly so I needed a new one badly.,2,2
My grandkids love these tablets.They are easy for them and they are having a great time with them,2,2
I recommend this and the Apple TV. They are both great products. I like the voice remote. Plus if you have Amazon prime. You can you Prime tv.,2,2
LOVE my Kindle Fire. Functions well and is a great and cheaper tablet alternative. Does everything I would want a tablet for at a much more reasonable price.,2,2
"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.",2,2
"This unit has a powerful processor, load contents very quick and stream the movie so smooth.",2,2
Easy to scroll through the menu t watch what you want.just less the price of others,2,2
I enjoy reading ebooks on this tablet as well as watching videos. It's just so handy to carry around in my purse.,2,2
Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.,2,2
Ordered online. Quick delivery and easy set up. Works great,2,2
Its is a great product.Fast and reliable.Streaming and services are the best,2,2
Fast and easy to use. Downloading apps is convenient.,2,2
Was hesitate to order this because I thought it might be difficult to hook up. Step by step instructions from the app and the echo was so easy to set up. Volume is spectacular!! Amazing what you can ask Alexa...still learning and playing. Love it so much I ordered another dot for the bedroom.,2,2
Good buy for the price. Easy to surf the web a lot of apps in the App Store,1,2
I wanted to find a way to stream The Grand Tour and the Fire TV works great. Our first streaming experience- very easy to use with Amazon Prime and high speed internet.,2,2
If you are a Amazon prime member it's a must have even if your not you will love this I got the 4 k one could not be happier,2,2
"Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average.",1,0
I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it,2,2
"If you're expecting something like an iPad, leave your expectations at the door. This is a great little tablet for losing track of time while you read, play a game, connect with family/friends, or watch a show. I've had iPads for years, and have loved using them--just getting tired of the price tags that come with them.",2,2
"Got this for our home gym to stream workout guides, Netflix, and music if - Super fast streaming, great quality build and performance, love the Alexa remote and integration with Amazon prime - all the apps and content u could ask for - haven't use the free time parental controls but that will be for our third one of these!",2,2
"Brought this for my son for xmas, he loved it and was very happy with it.",2,2
"Love this item, faster and better than firestick and other devices",2,2
"I got this for my mom to use as her ""computer"" and I am so happy with it. It's ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!!",2,2
great idea will recommend to everyone just can't stop playing with it,2,2
Much better than a fire stick. Well worth the extra money.,2,2
"Purchased for my 9 year old. Great for kids. Ads on lock screen are annoying and battery life is not as I'd like, and takes a long time to fully charge. Must prepare and charge overnight.",2,2
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!",2,2
My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!,2,2
Easy to get started with usefulFeatures. As I learn of new skills and try them Alexa gets more entertaining. Efficient and helpful assistant.,2,2
This was the 4th one I purchased and I love them. My grandkids play on them for hours and I get to choose what games they can play.,2,2
"I love everything about this item. I can watch whatever, whenever, particularly on Kodi. Good bye and good riddance to cable!",2,2
"Bought this item for easy access to music and our family uses it for everything wether, news, grocery lists etc.",2,2
Bought it on thanksgiving night just opened pkg and the screen is crushed. Haven't been able to take it back but was told when I called in that they might not have any in stock.,0,2
"For the price this thing cannot be beat. It does more than expected, very pleased.",2,2
"This is third Kindle product and the size, battery life and readability have improved with each new generation. Very happy with product and will continue to purchase in the future as new versions become available.",2,2
"Easy way to listen news, weather and traffic in the morning. My husband listen Pandora.",2,2
"I bought this as an alternative to my previous rechargeable Bluetooth speaker. Seemed like every time I went to use it the battery was dead. Echo is always plugged in and ready to go, and the interface is an added bonus. For $4 a month I subscribed to Amazon unlimited and just request Alexa to play songs to my hearts desire. I use it as a clock to wake me up in the morning, and control my lights! Highly recommended!",2,2
"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!",2,2
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime,2,2
bought as a gift and they loved it. it works fast and good,2,2
Truly I should have tried to get a refund. I threw out the packaging before I realized how poorly it works. This charger only works every third day when held at a particular angle. The planets almost need to align for it to charge my Kindle. Complete disappointment.,0,0
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.,2,2
"I researched and researched and researched streaming boxes from so many companies, including Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, and other off brands. By far, the Amazon TV was the best option for flexibility and reliability. I currently have three boxes now for each of my TVs and run PlayStation Vue. I have cut my cable bill by almost $70 per month. Plus, I now have the flexibility of other movie apps, Amazon content, and much more. The switch to streaming TV took less than 30 minutes. What a great investment with a very quick return.",2,2
Got the Echo for my husband who just loves it. I think it has become his best friend,2,2
Did not think I would like this product. I now own two!,2,2
My 3 yr old granddaughter loves this item! PERFECT,2,2
It is a good product. Didn't want glare when I read. It serves the purpose,2,2
Awesome for kids. Great for parents (peace and quiet) lol,2,2
"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it.",2,2
Extremely easy to set up using the Alexa app on your phone. Outstanding voice recognition. Was able to be in a different room of my house and still be able to command it. Great speaker quality as well!,2,2
I was very satisfied with this tablet. It was priced really cheaply but it is a decent little tablet.,2,2
Very easy to use. Great for travel. Access to many many movies.,2,2
I love it would recommend it .. Works great and takes really good pic,2,2
Faster than the firestick I definitely would buy another one much better than Google Chrome,2,2
I'm a cable cutter and Amazon Fire TV has been a God send. I have more content now than with cable. Highly recommend this producg.,2,2
"The box works great it is compact, easy to install and all around easy to navigate. The only reason I did not give the full star rating is that my remote keeps giving out. It will work most the time then it will just stopped I have replaced the batteries. That's not the issue I actually have to take the batteries out and put them back in to some times get the remote working again. I am hoping getting the remote replaced will be easy and hassle free",2,2
"I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality.",2,2
Very happy with my product. Best Buy staff was extremely helpful,2,2
"I had an original Kindle (wifi only) and loved it, however was limited when reading at night (I didn't want to have to attach a light or use a flashlight). The Kindle Paperwhite solves my dilemma! I would specifically recommend it for those who are frequent fliers.",2,2
The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.,2,2
"I had the Fire stick, and the performance was sluggish at best, constant buffering and powering off. I upgraded to the Fire tv and the difference is night and day. I don't know why I waited! no issues thus far and I couldn't be happier.",2,2
everything is cool with Echo but the sound quality can be made better for sure. Also there needs to be way to equalize volume as needed.,2,2
"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!",2,2
"Amazon makes an amazing product that turns any tv into a smart TV. Slim, sleek and extremely easy to install and use.",2,2
This purchase opened up so many options for viewing that we didn't have before. Easy to install and operate.,2,2
We got this tablet for our son to use in school and it's perfect for just that. At the right price too.,2,2
I bought this tablet for my daughter and she really loves it!,2,2
I no longer have cable nor do I need it now that I have the firestick!,2,2
I would recommend this product great for web photo bible studying video tango and some much more.. Go and get you one trust me you would love it..,2,2
"I purchased the item for $33 and was shocked when I began using it that the battery lasted 10 hours with moderate use, came with 6 months of free newspaper subscription and was preloaded with a lot of features. Its not the fastest in the world and I would prefer more storage, but for the price and considering how well it works I'm giving it 4 stars.",2,2
I had got the original for the wife she finally needed a new one so when I saw this online I had to get her a new one she loves it,2,2
"great for reading outside in the sun, or in dark rooms. very easy on the eyes.",2,2
"Has game selections, most my kids play. Great for daily use!",2,2
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.,2,2
"Traveling in coach is horrible, so I was looking for a small light weight dedicated device that allowed me to focus on reading. This product is perfection. I've read several books on various iPhones, including my 7+ over the years, but they're nothing like the paper white display.",2,2
"Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home.",2,2
We debated in getting the larger or smaller screen and I'm glad we went with the larger one. My son uses it every day and loves it!,2,2
Does what is says and more. Although initially somewhat complicated to get things going.,2,2
The Amazon Echo is a great friend in the room who will play whatever music you ask for. It's great to just ask Alexa and the echo responds accurately.,2,2
Ok overall but brakes easily with obly one fall to the floor,1,2
"We have a tv that already has Netflix and Amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other devices. We love this this thing and highly recommend it just ask Alexa for stuff instantly you have music, movies, and shopping.",2,2
Little disappointed in. Item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read.,1,2
you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music,2,2
I got this for my mother who isn't very tech savvy as I needed to get her something to get use to touch screens and smart devices. Its fairly user friendly and she is doing well with it.,2,2
Excellent device. Light weight and easy on eyes. Next time I'll get a black one instead of the white to minimize glare in sunlight.,2,2
the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time,2,2
"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",2,2
"The tablet is good for my son, he enjoys using it to play games.",2,2
I'm use to android so this was hard for me but I returned it and got something andriod,0,2
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. I was undecided between the Fire stick or the Fire TV and since a coworker has the Fire TV and loved it I went with the Fire TV as opposed to the stick - especially since there is more memory in the Fire TV (the TV is about 50.00 more but worth it),2,2
I really enjoy reading books on this. Glare in the sun but great indoors.,2,2
Very good!,2,2
I had purchased the Fire stick before the box. It runs a lot smoother and lags far less than the stick.,2,2
Good for the price. Low memory but good descent graphics easy to use,1,2
Great tablet for the price! Perfect for my son !!!,2,2
"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it.",2,2
I love using this to stream movies instead of using my old PS3. Great picture quality and pretty fast.,2,2
This was an upgrade from old Kindle. Screen is great and love the size of the screen.,2,2
It is very easy and lightweight to carry around and use,2,2
Got this for 35$ thanksgiving day. Lighter than the original and actually faster than ipad air. The 32 micro sd only cost me 9$. There is no way ipad can beat this!!!,2,2
"Fathers day gift. Bought the Google home, could not connect to his wifi. I took it back and got this. What a pain to set up. It was the new router he bought not the Echo.He likes it so far.",2,2
I am so glad i got this tablet i can take it with me anywhere and use anytime,2,2
Great products. Haven't used the shoulder bag much. I don't travel much. Nice to have just in case.,2,2
I love my Echo! Bought a second one for a gift and a Dot for my upstairs.,2,2
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.,2,2
I purchased these as door prizes and they are always loved to those who win!,2,2
Works well but after memory builds it starts acting up. Shuts on and off randomly. But for the price it's ok.,1,2
Easy To Use · Long Battery Life · Quality Build · Quality Display,2,2
Great simple to use light weight and love that's its wireless,2,2
Well worth the money. Bye-bye cable company bills.,2,2
"Haven't used much or found out all that it is capable to do, but, so far it is fun. Will say more later after I try a few things.",2,2
This is the third time I have purchased this item for the tv's in my house. I completely love it,2,2
"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already.",2,2
"For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix). So be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage.",1,0
Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup,2,2
I love how clear and bright the display is. Also love how light it is.,2,2
Many features this tablet has and is a great price!,2,2
"Bought it for my wifes Yoga Training Course.So much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!Cheaper books, music, emails.. What more do you need?",2,2
"Very nice product, works seamlessly. Very easy to setup. easy to down load apps and has a faster processor. You can down load the movies/songs and other stuff if you connect the hard drive. Voice activated remote is an added benefit.",2,2
"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy.",2,2
I feel giving a kindle to kids is better than losing an iPad,2,2
"Initially I figured this would be just a fun toy, so I resisted buying one for a long time. I finally gave in and kept my receipt in the event I needed to return it. I absolutely love it and even purchased the Echo Dot. It is a great way to tie all your smart home products together and to simply ask for something to happen. There are plenty of YouTube videos of unique ways to use Alexa. I use Wink (not too happy with it), but with Alexa, those products work very well. The speaker is excellent when you pair it to your phone to listen to music. Alexa is not 100% perfect and she does not always understand what you are saying, but it is improving.",2,2
It has been a great streaming device. Its very reliable.,2,2
Well worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account. Easy set up....excellent streaming quality. My only complaint is that I wish the speech search feature (there is a speech recognition search feature) worked with other apps.,2,2
"The more I thought about using my phone to read ebooks, the less I wanted to read. But the Voyage has gotten me back into reading. Light. Holds charge for week at least. Only request is I wish it could do white letters on black at night.",2,2
The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.,2,2
I saw this item on Amazon if I had ordered it from them I would had to wait 30 days. Best Buy had it in stock for the same price. Having uses it for several weeks I found its a great small tablet for a great price. I plan to buy several more as stocking stuffer. For an entry level tablet you can't beat it.,2,2
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",2,2
I think this is the best purchase I've made all year. Nothing better to say,2,2
i have been wanting a kindle for some time and am very happy with it,2,2
"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.",2,2
You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!,2,2
"I purchased this instead of the fire stick to pair with my new 4K tv. Easy to use, huge selection, small sleek design blends in to my entertainment system.",2,2
The fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. The charger is shorter than it should be. My son likes it,2,2
I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.,2,2
"It is very easy to set up and use. It has great functions, but am waiting for more to be added to give 5 stars.",2,2
The tab is very good for the price what is being offered. Allows to have separate kid profile as well so that they don't have access to unwanted stuff. YouTube app can be installed as well.,2,2
I got it for my god son and he loves it .it's east use to,2,2
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",2,2
For the price it has great sound and very good responses to tough questions.,2,2
this kindle was for my 3yr old so she would stop using mine. she really enjoys it and caught on really quickly to the updates compared to mine that was purchased 2 yrs prior.,2,2
My granddaughter love it works good she is on it all day.,2,2
This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.,2,2
"The kindle fire has all the things you need to read books, surf the net and play!",2,2
"Works on wireless networks, awesome for streaming 1080p AND 4K content.",2,2
"What's not to like? This thing does it all. If you are a trivia buff, you will be occupied for hours, So much info in a small cylinder with a tiny footprint. It is unobtrusive, fits in with any decor. Keeps the grandkids busy for hours.What will they think up next? It's already been replaced by a similar unit with a screen. (the look). It performs as they say, with enough microphones that can hear across a loud room. The speakers are good, but don't expect to be blown away.My advice...find it on a big sale and enjoy.",2,2
Bought this to read out by the pool. Works great! Only thing that could make it better would be if you could adjust text size for imported PDFs.,2,2
Bought this for my 6 year old nephew and he loves it!,2,2
This is a very fun and useful devise. Very easy to setup! It has great sound. I was able to setup with the apps to turn on/off my TV along with my lights. I love how there are so many new apps. I can't wait to connect it to my Sonos speakers.I love it so much I purchase several of the Amazon Dot for my family members for Christmas gifts.,2,2
Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.,2,2
I bought two for my kids for Christmas. They love it.,2,2
Would recommend - it does what it claims in the commercials,2,2
"Bought this for my mom. She mostly plays games on it, but loves it.",2,2
"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase.",2,2
The new paperwhite reaches the sweet point of price and specs. I'll not pay for the extra 80 bucks just for the page press.,2,2
"I bought the echo in white. I think it looks better than the black one. Also bought a dot for the bedroom. If you get this and an Insteon starter kit, you can use Alexa to control your plug in lamps. It works well and I recommend buying it.",2,2
The Fire TV is an awesome device. Great for Netflix and Hulu streaming.,2,2
Nice tablet for the price. I wish the colorful ones available in the store.,2,2
Bought this so my brother could watch his videos on something other than my phone.,2,2
"So far I've had my Fire Tablet for over a month. Its my first tablet. The lack of the Googlke Play store means the Amazon apps are pretty limited, but I found avway around that. The front camera is grainy but acceptance while using Skype. Battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. For a $50 first tablet, I suppose those are acceptable flaws. Feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight.",2,0
Works as described. I really like the ease of use when it comes to the interface.,2,2
"I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it.",2,2
"I returned and got the 8"" since this turned this product and would not turn on. I got another since it was a gift.",0,2
Got this as a gift for my sister. She was running out of book shelf space this was the great idea. She loved this gift and it has a light so you can read this one in the dark.,2,2
"We have a couple of these now for our kids. Create a kid account and allow access to a few apps, add a memory card for more storage for movie video files that you have and it's enough to entertain the kids on car trips or keep them from going nuts in restaurants occasionally.",2,2
"If you are looking for a decent tablet for a great price, look no further because this is the bee's knee's.",2,2
I bought this for my 2 yr old. (For his first experience with plane rides and airport waiting) it was very helpful in keeping him quiet and occupied. It can be a bit slow depending on your wifi connection but not problem enough for me to dislike it.,2,2
It is fun to tell Alexia to play Bruno Mars on Pandora,2,2
"I had my doubts about the utility of the echo but with amazons continuous updating of its skills, I've come to rely on it for a lot of things, even mundane tasks like my morning alarm clock. I just tell Alexa when to wake me up. Can't wait to purchase some more smart home appliances to integrate other stuff around the house.",2,2
"I love Alexa! She is so helpful to have in my everyday life, and so entertaining too. And I love her smart home connections; I can control my smart home with my voice through her. My only complaint is that you can't give her two commands at once, but it's easy enough to separate the commands.",2,2
"Easy to operate once you get the hang of it! Loooooove that it lights up so no reading light is needed. I love reading so I don't need the games, movies etc that the Fire has.",2,2
This product blows ROKU out of the water! I would definitely recommend this to my friends!,2,2
Text is very crisp and easy to read. Would recommend to others,2,2
We bought this for the grandkids to use for school homework and it wotks very well. Easy for them to use.,2,2
Great for my grandchildren when they come over and then I use it also good for all ages .,2,2
My nephews are always playing with my smartphone so I bought this for them and they are happy to have their own device to play with.,2,2
I had the fire stick before buying this and though I liked the fire stick i thought it could be faster. The fire tv definitely bumps up the performance a bit and having the voice search really helps a lot and makes it better.,2,2
Works well also great for reading recommend 4 star,2,2
The Amazon Fire TV is very reliable and worth the price if you are a serious streamer I recommend it highly!,2,2
I like that the reader has a backlight for reading at night,2,2
"I do not have a connected home, but the Echo is fun to use. More skills are added by Amazon each week. The accuracy of the Echo understanding my voice commands are excellent! Unfortunately, only the Dot can stream via Bluetooth. I would give the Dot a look when it begins to be generally available...",2,2
I bought this because of its great price as a gift. It is a great tablet for someone entering the tablet experience. It has so many features just like the more expensive choices. Happy with purchase especially since we can add a memory card too . To,2,2
Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.,2,2
"It's still confusing trying to figure out how to use Alexa and the app. To me, Alexa does not answer many questions at all or she does not understand many questions at all but I just need really be able to sit down and play around with the app. Is real funny though.",2,2
I bought this for my bedroom. I have it to control lighting and wake me up. Awesome.,2,2
"The tablet is almost perfect, needs to add more apps",2,2
Amazon continues to improve Alexa. The product has unlimited potential.,2,2
It's really good for reading and for having a small tablet. To browse with.,2,2
"This isn't the best tablet, but for casual gaming, youtubing, the price was perfect for this tablet on black friday.",2,2
I took it on vacation in the Bahamas and Bald Head and read in the sun and in the pool.,2,2
I bought this product for my grandmother since she has a hard time reading the small print in books. The Kindle Paperwhite has a large font setting that has made reading much easier for her and the matte screen provides for minimized glare. She can now easily read a book again!,2,2
"For those on a budget, this tablet gets the job done. No buyer's remorse.",2,2
This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.,2,2
Good for someone who loves music. The speaker is loud and I enjoy using it.,2,2
"Good platform, easy to use although a keyboard might prove more helpful that having to ask Alexa.",2,2
"Not the most powerful tablet out there, but excellent for the price",2,2
"Great product, would recommend it if you need a low budget tablet.",2,2
This was a gift for my daughter. It's easy to use and can do a lot,2,2
Great tablet for children and for entertainment...,2,2
"I purchased this tablet for my 2 year old and she loves it. She able to watch all her shows abd play games , its great...",2,2
with the Alexa voice it saves a lot of time and worry,2,2
No surprises with this purchase - Works well and am pleased with it...,2,2
I love this tablet. Easy to use and has a lot of features.,2,2
"Setup went smoothly (vs. Roku that could never detect wifi), picture quality very good. Menus a little squirrelly and navigation/selection could be better, but not awful. Only negative so far is that remote seems to devour AAA batteries.",2,1
"We have 2 Echo's, one in the living room and the other upstairs. Alexa will not only play whatever music you ask her to, but she will tell you the weather, a joke, is a timer, an alarm clock, keeps a grocery list, will notify someone of your choosing of an emergency at home, is a companion for an elderly person, or even keep a paraplegic company just by using their voice. There are hundreds of Apps that you can download, that enables Alexa to do on your command. We use the Echo everyday and have listened to our favorite songs from our past as well as current hits and/or radio stations. She has become a welcome addition to our home. Buy one, you won't regret it.",2,2
This item is great! We have an apple TV for our other TV in our house but this item blows it out of the water. the ability to access so many additional things and apps is exactly what we needed. Plus being able to access the Amazon Prime music options and TV/Movie rentals makes it so we do not need to run to RedBox any longer.,2,2
"There's a lot of growing functionality with this product. I have a Philips Hue setup in my home, and it's nice to just ask for a certain lamp or set of lamps to turn on, off, dim or brighten. Saves me a trip to the lightswitch!The bluetooth speaker functionality seems spotty, as I have it connecting to my PC and it will arbitrarily disconnect, whereas other bluetooth speakers within about the same radius will connect and stay on.Aside from that, it's rather like having your phone handy and constantly listening to you, so you need not pull it out and ask for your appointments (or make them), and other things you might be used to doing with the Google Voice feature (or Siri).",2,2
"The product is easy to understand and use. If you have already viewed a series from Plex, Hulu, or another provider, the remote will take you to where you left off. If you want to view something from Amazon Prime you press the button and speak the name and it finds it for you.",2,2
"It make take a little getting use to, but it is very helpful.",2,2
"This is great. It's pretty quick, it works, has USB connections for data, or for a mouse + keyboard, it's small, strong and neat. 4K is okay... but still not a ROKU 4 in terms of screen quality in my opinion. Although Fire is feels a little snappier, less noisy and heats less than the ROKU 4. I like it and will obviously keep it, but 4 stars just because there's room to improve it to be a nicer 4K streamer.",2,2
"Performance of the device is good, meets expectations.",2,2
The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls,2,2
doesn't allow for my apps but with memory card it will.,2,2
Was a nice deal for 50 bucks can't beat that and its fast and works great,2,2
I love the easy access to all of the apps especially the Netflix app.,2,2
"My grandkids love these, purchased 3 for the 6 - 7 year old. Per them ""the best gift I got""",2,2
Works well for my children. They both have one and seems to run smoothly for the games and apps they use.,2,2
Easy to navigate with plenty of apps. Simple connection,2,2
"This tablet performs surprisingly well, especially considering it's just $50. The HD screen produces good images & great video. I own two iPad Minis, and I must say that while this is not quite as exotic as the Mini, the price makes it the better value hands down. One key feature is that it has a micro SD slot, which allows you to instantly increase storage capacity (up to 128GB, I believe). This makes it very capable of managing large amounts of photos & videos.",2,2
I got this tablet for my daughter and it does everything that's she needs it for. It runs all the apps she has downloaded and not much lag when opening the apps.,2,2
.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet,2,2
I found the Paper white Kindle so easy to get used to. I always preferred paper books and could never get used to reading on my iPad or iPad mini because of the weight of them. The Kindle is user friendly and light to hold. I love it!,2,2
I just need to learn about all the ways I can use this. But love it so far!,2,2
I bought this for my dad for Xmas and I ended it up using it more than him while on vacation and I loved it!,2,2
"A little nervous about buying this product online since I always buy in store products, but this was the best service I could ask for. I was able to follow my order at anytime . The order was received quickly and without any hassles.",2,2
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop.",2,2
The size and how easy it is to navigate all the features is a super plus.,2,2
If you have a smart-home you're going to love this device. I have it integrated with my Hue and Nest products and it works flawlessly. Highly recommend for voice command to smart devices and easy ordering from Amazon.,2,2
"The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use.",2,2
Works great! Still trying to figure it all out but I have no problems so far. I am looking forward to expanding my uses for it but so far it makes for a great speaker!,2,2
"Echo is fun to play with, but doesn't understand a lot of questions and the ""skills"" don't work if you don't use the correct wording. The app needs some work bc you have to look through all of the skills to find the right questions, you can't just search the skills that are enabled. I'm sure that it will get better with time, but for now, it's fun to have around.",2,2
It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.,2,2
We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching,2,2
Listens to my every word and isn't insulted when i tell her she is dumb as a stone!,2,2
I absolutely love my Echo.I greet her in the morning and she greets me back and sometimes has an occasion to talk about.I love that she plays music too.,2,2
I had an old Kindle and this product is a lot easier to hold. I like the feel of the screen when turning the pages it almost feels like real paper.,2,2
"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME",2,0
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.,2,2
Alexa is so much fun. Love the jokes and the ability to get any information I need by simply asking,2,2
good product***********************************************,2,2
I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my son along with the amazon fire 7 case. The tablet has a neat kid free time feature that you can use to limit time spent on tablet and control web sites viewed. The features are great but a little time is needed to enable these features. Over all four stars/ 5 if it was easier to use and didn't have to much advertising on locked screen.,2,2
The Kindle is very great reader and recommendable for people.,2,2
Love this. Great for bed- time stories & timers for kids.,2,2
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good.",2,2
Love fireTVs and Firesticks. They always work well.,2,2
"If you want a good e-reader Amazon has a number of options, but some of the newer ones are unexpectedly expensive. This one is great if you want to read any time but not break the bank.",2,2
This perfect for my mom who loves to listen to auto book's.,2,2
I chose this product over the fire stick because it's hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby w I chose this product over the fire stick because is hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby your unit.,2,2
"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value.",2,2
The best gift for someone and you could download a lot of games,2,2
It has good sound and can pick up my voice in a normal speaking tone.,2,2
"I bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! She is in love with it - it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. It's quite durable as well - seeing as how a four-year-old has his hands on it quite often :)The only thing that could be improved is the camera quality - but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. Just to edit them!",2,2
Who needs a laptop that takes up so much space? Go for this Amaon Fire that fits in your hands. It has capabilities for multiple accounts and time limits for children...or even your spouse. Worth the price and very convenient. No lap required.,2,2
Bought this for basic web browsing and low-requirement games. Serves purpose at a cheap price and has good quality and help support.,2,2
"Useful for weather, news and listening to music while in kitchen. We have used to control some lights. Great for grocery lists.",2,2
"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",2,2
The amazon fire tv is great in all aspects and is so fast,2,2
The amazon kindle paperwhite is perfect for reading before bed and anywhere really. The paperwhite is lightweight and easy to use. The paperwhite allows me to read my saved books from the amazon kindle app from anywhere.,2,2
my 2 almost 3 year old son for Christmas it is great even for adults as well very sturdy and holds but to a wild 2 year old,2,2
I got this tablet for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it,2,2
This can be used in any conditions. Very user friendly.,2,2
Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.,2,2
Easy to replace old Kindle. Like larger screen and light,2,2
Simple hook up to smart phone and Internet. Love this product and learning more uses for it every day.,2,2
"The first one had a lag with the remote as it would randomly stop working but once I replaced it, it worked just fine.",2,0
No longer takes charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger. Product did not last very long since had 7 months.,0,0
The screen is Crack already with the kids proof case,1,2
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,1,2
"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.",2,2
"BestBuy had this Echo for sale at half it's regular price. We bought one and are having all kinds of interesting fun. Imagine when your hands are full and you say ""Alexa, set timer"". Not to mention all the other requests that may come up. Use you imagination.",2,2
Perfect tablet for my niece. Don't have to worry about her getting into anything she's not suppose to. Also don't have to worry about her watching things that aren't appropriate for her age.,2,2
Once u get her updated and on track she is ok.you download the app and away she goes,2,2
"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad.",2,2
I have 2 of those and work great and fast is a Bluetooth.,2,2
"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.",2,0
I like the tablet it has a slot for a memory card for extra storage. It is easy to use and inexpensive.,2,2
"Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary",2,2
This Fire TV works great for playing some games and streaming content. It's a plus that it's 4K enabled. Haven't really been able to use the 4K so can't comment on that,2,2
"Difficult to get set up and logged in. This product was a gift to an elderly person and she had difficulty logging in. Had to go to Best Buy for assistance. Kept repeating log in was already being used. I have purchased 4 kindle fire tabletsas gifts and everyone seems to be enjoying them. Two were for kids, they enjoy downloading games.",2,2
I use it for audiobooks a lot of the time . It has a good clear sound. Very easy to download books from the library .The battery seems to last a reasonable amount of time.,2,2
A great price for an e-reader with a great battery life. Love the e-ink too.,2,2
Alexa easily understands and responds. Great tool to use make lists...I do not have to reach for a pen and paper!!,2,2
"We are trying to make a smart house and Alexa here is the best. Alexa turns on everything we ask her to as long as we do not speak too fast. She is great for telling news briefs, weather updates, sports facts and conversions. She even plays the amazon playlists. If I am in the other room, she can still hear me if I speak a bit louder. I love Alexa!",2,2
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",1,0
"I've had my Echo for a few weeks now, and it is awesome. It's so easy to use the voice commands. There are also a lot of possible connections and add ons in the Alexa App. Great purchase.",2,2
"i HAD both an Echo and a Google Home. I ended up returning the Google Home and kept the Echo only. The list of skills is great and the big advantage. Also all of the CES 2017 announcements made it clear that the industry, at least at this point, loves the echo. I couldnt agree more!",2,2
"I bought this after I bought my Firestick, and this is faster. Works great with Netflix, easy to install and load, picture quality is fantastic.",2,2
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet.",2,2
"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.",2,2
"I find this satisfies my desire for a book reader and small tablet at an excellent price ($39.95 - on special sale). It is a version of Android, and will take many but not all android apps. Actually, I haven't used many conventional android apps with it, and none of them has failed to work. I have been able to use Bluetooth accessories such as keyboard and powered external speaker. I would buy this again, and actually have. But the second time is as a gift.",2,2
Brought it for my mom and she loves it . It is easy to use and it works great!!,2,2
A steal for a tablet to surf the internet or control automation,2,2
"love my new echo, works well pros easy to install does not take to much room. The sound is crisp. My only grip is i paid 50.00 more then what the price was in xmas.",2,2
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all,2,2
My wife and I love our Kindles when cruising or out at the beach. They work great in sun and are compact and travel well.,2,2
This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad.,2,2
I love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glasses. Pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading I'm right back where i left off. Love it. Capacity is unbelievable.,2,2
Work good with my internet. Have basic cable and use this to watch movies and steam tv shows.,2,2
"solid product by amazon, for streaming with various services.",2,2
It's very convenient for readers and online use! It works quickly and is great,2,2
"I bought a few of these over the holiday for my niece, nephews and step daughter. They love it. I especially love the parental locks and restrictions that can be put in place. Helps to minimize what the children have access to.",2,2
Very useful. More better for reading than ipad. good for eyes,2,2
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.",1,2
Customer service rep took my sale was horrible. Would not recommend her as a customer friendly person,2,2
"Awesome Video streamer, once rooted, unlocked and loaded the possibilities are truly unlimited.",2,2
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....,2,2
Imagine my 4 grandkids joy when they opened their gifts. Love love love them!,2,2
This is as much fun as I expected it to be. Love that I can play music and change songs hands free while cooking.,2,2
"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!",2,2
Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.,2,2
"The amazon echo works great. News, sports, weather, and so much more! Excellent purchase.",2,2
Bought just for fun during a special sale and we love it! Bought the Echo Dot too. Easy to set up and use. Love it for bedtime to get music or sounds to fall asleep. Timer is great and alarm feature is very helpful as a back up to my phone.,2,2
"Ok, but sometimes alexa begin speaking without being asked, and sometimes light spins around when asked alexa a question without any answer.",1,2
This has met all my expectations and they are continually adding features to Alexa without any updating or upgrading by me.,2,2
"Bought this as a 2nd tablet for my mom gor xmas. Its been well over 6 months, it is still going amazingly well!",2,2
The Kindle Paperwhite is light and I love the backlight. It's great for basic reading,2,2
"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids.",2,2
Works great with sling tv to fill the gap in shows I watch,2,2
I love my new paperwhite. I can download books quickly and now read more books.,2,2
"With the backlight, I can read without turning the light. Also the paperwhite is really easy on the eye.",2,2
Sounds great. Picks up voice very well and responds quickly.,2,2
I really like this Kindle. It has more features than the Kindle Fire 6. And the processor is a little bit faster as well. It is great for reading for the price and it is very economical as well.,2,2
"Amazon has created a great, smooth, intuitive and responsive interface. It works and works well.",2,2
My son likes the tablet well enough. He really only watches videos and plays games on it.,2,2
"Good for price, could have bought android tablet but it was no name for the same price. So went with it and my 5 year old really likes it. Just be careful of putting your credit card in. My son charged a bunch of games before I caught it. I thought he was just downloading free apps.",2,2
My husband gave me one for Christmas and I love It!!!! My entire family uses it. My son is visually impaired so he has access to so much with alex!!!,2,2
My kids love them very good and they enjoy playing there game and music,2,2
"I enjoy being able to ask Alexa to play music, tell me the weather or give me the latest headlines on the news all while I'm walking around my house. Totally love it",2,2
"Usually, a $50 tablet is some cheap knockoff/no name brand limited capability tablet. For an Amazon tablet, You can't beat the price. If you're an Amazon shopper/user, this'll be a great tablet for your kid, an elderly adult in your care &/or you. For $50 (or less if you catch it on sale), I'll take the ads",2,2
"Very simple, very light and has all the basic features you will be looking for in a tablet but don't expect a fancy device",2,2
I love the small size as it is very comfortable to hold... the look and feel is very much like an actual book!!,2,2
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.,2,2
I have tried to get it work& still can't get it to work!!,1,2
"I found the Amazon Fire TV responds faster than the Amazon Fire Stick. Plus it has an ethernet port! On my setup, this helps out a lot since I have 8 Fire TVs running Plex. If all of those were on one WiFI AP it would probably kill the bandwidth. The Amazon Fire TV loads quickly and works as expected. The only thing I don't like is I wish I could customize the home screen so it would only show what I want it to.",2,1
"In terms of mid-tier streaming devices, (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), I think the Amazon Fire TV is by far the best. The interface is neat and well designed, and the product has the most recent technology to allow for fast streaming over lower-tier streaming devices like the Chromecast or Fire Stick. In addition, I think the Amazon streaming devices offer better features for Prime members than what other devices can offer.",2,2
"I got this for basic internet access, reading kindle books and watching Netflix. Works great. No problems. Now, if you want to download a ton of shows, extra memory will be needed.",2,2
Waiting to see what developes .So far so good. Hooked in now,2,2
"I love the fire tablet so much so that I have purchased about 9 for my son, nieces and nephews",2,2
WORKS GREAT BUT NEEDS SOME WORK WITH UPDATES TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND GIVE MORE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.,2,2
haven't opened it yet as i bought it for my grand baby for christmas!....i'm sure she'll love it!!!,2,2
This tablet performs very well. It is great for someone that does not need a sophisticated tablet. Great value for the price.,2,2
My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect,2,2
Just a great product and the price is very competable,2,2
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.,2,2
Led to more echo dots and significant home automation.,2,2
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.,2,2
I love this tablet and it's easy to use. I would buy another for sure!,2,2
It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.,2,2
Great for reading in bed or reading on the beach in the sun (with or without sunglasses).,2,2
Worth the extra bucks to buy the TV over stick and plug in your Ethernet cable.,2,2
I bought 2 for my kids for reading and they are slowly but gradually picking up how to use them. They thought I bought it to download games. I told them one game each and the rest books.,2,2
I was just looking for a tablet that wasn't expensive and had good quality graphics and I was please with my purchase.,2,2
This table working perfect. Ir has very good resolution,2,2
Paid 50 bucks for it and with that you can't complain. Great for a general use tablet,2,2
I couldn't pass this one up for the money. Buy them for your kids so they can stay occupied for hours and get fat.,2,2
The person who I gave this to is enjoying this gift,2,2
It's silly these aren't provided with the purchase of a Kindle. Super expensive.,0,2
"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun.",2,2
"This is a very good tablet for use with streaming. It does lack some apps like youtube however, since it isn't connected to the google play store. If you are an amazon prime member this is an extremely good buy since you can easily access all of your prime benefits right from the home screen.",2,2
"Not disappointed, if you want good screen for movies, this is it",2,2
"Works for what my mom wanted it for. Some of the questions we ask Alexa she doesn't know, but I guess they will work on getting updated information.",2,2
"It washer, it vacuums and it dries the floor in one easy touch.",2,2
"Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time",2,2
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot,2,2
Product work great. Loaded Kodi to watch movies and have not had any trouble. Definitely recommend this for anyone who has decided to get rid of the cable/satellite.,2,2
As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.,2,2
I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!,2,2
"The paper white is a terrific reader and, for all light conditions, is superior to the kindle fire we had previously. No glare, easy read, easy use, with adjustable type print. We recommend it highly.",2,2
"It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier.",2,2
"So having this device has been great, Amazon prime aside, (as you can watch all of the great stuff Amazon has to offer if you are a Prime member) this devices allows excellent DLNA media streaming, access to online media applications such as netflix and many music sites as well.On my Smart TV i've always had an issue with the Netflix application crashing or not being able to connect for reasons unknown, and I constantly had to reset the entire ""Smart TV"" to get it working again ""maybe"".Using Netflix via the Fire TV, has never been easier, it actually makes the picture seem even more crisp than the native netflix application on my 4K Ultra HD 3D TV, go figure. the app doesn't crash on me, and i don't even use the Netflix app on the dumb i mean smart tv i have, i go right to the fire tv.This is a must have device for all things media.",2,2
"Profound content provided by this TV box. Plus 3rd party apps, you can watch free tv and sports.",2,2
"outstanding time filler, weather traveling or just relaxing. SD card expandable to hold several movies. Oh, and hey, front and rear cameras. And all on the cheep.",2,2
"The kindle paper white is Lightweight, easy to use, works great outside, love reading at night with the built in lighted screen too! Love how you can adjust the size of the print so easily too!",2,2
"Kind of slow,but with the price it's acceptable. I bought it for my son and he doesn't care for speed.",2,2
"Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory.",2,2
Great reader for elderly. Bought this for my mother. She loves it,2,2
"I did my research and purchased one of these for one purpose, to side load Kodi on it. I was told in the store by an Associate that Amazon had blocked this ability, but this was not true. I had no intention of Rooting the box and it was not needed. It side loaded so simply that anyone could do it, no PC needed. It has a faster processing speed and better picture quality then the Amazon Fire Stick..and this does 4K video. Amazing little media box that has tons of entertainment for a small price. If you have fast enough internet I would highly recommend picking one up!",2,1
Got it for my wife but I keep it. Got to get her one now.lol,2,2
"Without costing a ton like the Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV has everything a cord cutter could want.",2,2
What a great device. The paperwhite is much clearer to see than on an iphone or android. Easy on the eyes,2,2
First kindle. Only used a few things. It was easy to set up. Now to purchase another for my daughter and see how easy to link.,2,2
No issues with the product. I am a satisfied customer.,2,2
"Performance up to expectations, but battery life less than expected and advertised. Backlight functions well.",2,2
My 9 yr old daughter loves to play with it. Be careful children don't order prime.,2,2
Probably the best priced tablet on the market. Works well.,2,2
"No complaints. Works great, even in the bright sun and at night!",2,2
I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.,2,2
Had troubles at first as I was using a dual modem/router. Once I bought a separate modem and router it worked great and the picture is even better than what I was getting with Xfinity!,2,2
Great addition for reading on the go and shopping online. Compact and good battery life,2,2
"I bought this originally for my wife because she is always reading and was interested in a Kindle, though wasn't sure she could ever part with physical books. She loves it! Now with the Family Library option available we can all share our favorite books. I'm looking to buy one for myself and my teenage daughter this week, actually. Oh, and my wife has given up on physical books after this ;) She likes the backlight when reading in bed at night and the fact that it lasts for at least a week on a single charge.",2,2
"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...",2,2
"I have always wanted to get the best products for the money for my audio video experience. The Amazon Fire for 4K has not disappointed. It was exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my TV. The updates for the Fire are seemless and fast. The visual quality is what was expected. If you already own the Fire would I recommend the upgrade? Do not know, but wish there was some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier. I do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those options extensively.",2,2
I bought 6 of these for christmas for my nieces and nephews. Best gift for the price. they love them for the online and app games.,2,2
The Amazon Fire TV is great. It was easy to set up and start using. The menu is very user friendly and easy to navigate.,2,2
Wish I didn't have to sign on with a card but great product,2,2
"got this for the wife, her first tablet experience was horrible. She loves this and can't live with out it!!!",2,2
excellent,2,2
"This is a great little tablet for the money and does nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet. I plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive iPad Air 2 home. I was impressed with the resolution when viewing photos and it works well for reading email and Internet surfing. It is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit. Probably the major drawback is the camera, which does not take a very good picture when compared to cell phones and other tablets. Again, for the money, it's a great value for a small tablet.",2,2
All my friends have a computer and I figured I would start with the tablet. I am very pleased with my choice.,2,2
Works great when connected directly to wifi router.,2,2
Got this for my 4K Sony. Works great. It's faster than the apps on the tv with more selection. Plus I really like the Alexa voice remote. You can just tell the remote what you want and it goes right to it. Searches all your apps!!,2,2
Purchased as gifts & have not heard of any defects,2,2
"My mom was perfectly happy with it, very user friendly for someone who is not really tech savvy.",2,2
Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.,2,2
Good for beginners. Wanted something simple and that's what I got,1,2
Seems to work great for my teenage son. He uses it to watch videos on it,2,2
I purchase the Echo Alexsa for my wife and nest temperature gauge. She absolutely loves it. From adjusting the house temp to asking her about the weather,2,2
"Purchased as a gift for tech-challenged loved one - setup and quick start very simple and straightforward. Ease of loading lots of free library books alone made it well worth the purchase. However, if you have reservations regarding outdoor glare, I'd recommend trying it out first-hand before buying.",2,2
I'm getting rid of my DirecTV subscription for this. I love it! I don't have to forward through commercials :),2,2
"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie.",2,1
"Good tablet wish I could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app I use would b more beneficial for kids",2,2
Responds quickly. Hears my command from quite a distance. If you buy into google schedule (monthly fee) it helps you keep track of appointments birthdays etc.,1,2
Bought to use with harmony hub to control tv and it does! Also very handy for things you used to have to look up on the internet - for example in the morning Alexa what is he weather forecast for today?,2,2
"For the price that I paid, 35 dollars, it is more than enough. the best is the front and rear camera.",2,2
I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.,2,2
"I dearly love my Alexa, She is able to give me the latest weather update. along with other very useful commands. Plus she can make me laugh on a regular basis.",2,2
Everyone in the family can enjoy asking Alexa questions. Where it doesn't know everything it does seem to get better. The skills available are fairly diverse and useful. This is a good place to start if you are interested in having a smart home. I bought the echo and the dot with the battery pack.,2,2
Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.,2,2
"This ereader is honestly the best that I could have bought for my first one. Now, I don't actually read often but wanted to buy something to help me read what I do have within my kindle account. I was stuck between getting this and the original kindle. Thankfully, I got this. Mostly because of the textured screen and backlighting. The backlight is what did it for me. I read reviews about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark, and that's when I would be reading the most. If I had seen how hard it really as to read, it would have gone back immediately.The weight is a little heavy for constant reading but nothing to really complain about. The battery life could supposedly last 8 weeks. But, apparently I am a bookworm. I have to charge it every other day with max settings.One thing I am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia, the notes, and the highlighting. It tells you when others have highlighted other sections of a book I am reading as well. Im not sure if this is in general a feature of the kindle products, but it is extremely useful.Overall , I think this is a great ereader for beginners and bookworms.",2,2
My husband bought me this for Christmas and I love it! Bigger than my phone but small enough for me to hold. I also bought a case for it that helps it to stand up.,2,2
I love the kindle.. Reading is so much easier especially traveling and at beach,2,2
The set up was complicated and I had to go to the Amazon web site to get it rightIt finally worked,2,2
The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.,2,2
So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.,2,2
I got this on sale for 33 dollars and I expected something different because of the low price. I would pay a hundred for a replacement if this one ever breaks. Very good product.,2,2
Who could could pass up such a deal under $50.Full color H D viewing and easy to use. Read a book or watch TV or a movie. This is an all around fun piece of equipment.,2,2
The Fire TV works just like it is supposed to. I got it mostly to watch CBS all access and it worked so well I purchased a second one 1 week later for another TV.,2,2
"I was very surprised by the quality and speed of this tablet, since it was only $40! I would highly recommend. Good for kids too - don't spend the extra money for the kid version, just buy them this one.",2,2
Battery wouldnt hold a charge but was able to get it teplaced.,2,2
The only time I really have to read is late at night when I don't want to turn on the lights and wake everyone up. The back light and touch screen make this version of the kindle much better than the previous ones.,2,2
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!,2,2
"Love the back light, fast response to changing pages. The kindle voyage is lite.",2,2
It was on sale. Worth it for a first time tablet buyer for something inexpensive,2,2
Easy to setup but doesn't do everything without additional products. Better than google home.,1,2
"I have the older Kindle with keyboard. This one is lighter, touchscreen, and has the back light. It was worth the extra $ to buy this one with the backlight. My daughter doesn't need to worry about whether she has a book light with her when she reads on long trips. A+",2,2
"This is a ok tablet, worth $50 is a little slow, but for the money it's ok",1,0
Easy to use. Sometimes does not understand or have the information. Use regularly as a kitchen timer and for weather updates.,2,2
The built in backlight is fantastic. Let you get a slimmer case that's easier to carry around,2,2
"Works great IMO altho when I first got it home the remote didn't work and appeared corroded insidewe called the store and they said I had to call some parts store, which said they were out of remotesKind of a run around IMO I got the remote fixed myself Other than that the box works grest",2,2
She says this was the best gift she ever received.,2,2
My fiance loves that she no longer has to go to abook store to purchase a book. she can now simply click download and read a book.,2,2
i have never used this product before found it to be very easy,2,2
"Bought one for my wife and my daughter who is in college. They both love them. easy to use, great screen and endless choices of material to read.",2,2
The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.,2,2
My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.,2,2
"Great product, works as expected. Cool features, my kids love it.",2,2
"this is one of my wifes favorite things , plays games , reads books ,",2,2
"I love having books at my finger tips, 24/7. In addition to accessibility, my kindle white increases my vocabulary by offering word wise.",2,2
I love to ask it to play my Pandora station while I cook!,2,2
This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.,2,2
Easy to use.Easy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play YouTube. The product said it will upscale to 4k quality but the picture show on the TV is the same as regular product without 4K.,1,2
"This is an OK device, decent speaker for casual listening. The voice recognition is not good though. When you have to yell and repeat commands over and over it gets frustrating.",2,2
Quick to set up. Fully satisfied. I protest about you review min letters,2,2
"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.",2,2
I would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a 64 gig sd card the main operating system only allows about 2 gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited,1,0
Great for my grandchildren to keep up on the reading during the summer months It's so easy for the parents to actually monitor whether they do or do not do the reading.,2,2
"Great item for someone who is home alone, most of the time. Talking to it is an helper in accomplishing complex tasks. Listening to it is pleasing in sitting still.",2,2
"I bought it for my daughters gift, she loves playing",2,2
Its little improved than previous version. Good deal at this price.,2,2
"After reading how fast this unit was, I was highly disappointed. My Roku 3 leaves the Amazon Fire Tv in the dust. It takes forever to load up, then freezes several times while being used.",1,0
"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed.",2,2
What a cool gadget. Great to have by the pool and change music without getting out.,2,2
I recommend this item and it works great. Go for it.,2,2
Love these firesticks its a very good device love the selection of movies.,2,2
work great sounds good work fast Good 4k tv you can add more thing,2,2
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!,2,2
"I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle. ReallyRead more",2,0
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.,2,2
Great device for someone who is not very technologically advanced. Easy to use and understand.,2,2
"I cringed at laying down paper to pick-up technology. However, it was the best thing I ever did. I have been very pleased with this reader.",2,2
This is so much better than roku. It's a must buy.,2,2
Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,1,2
This unit is great. It has everything that I need in it plus more. It's fast and responsive with great voice recognition. The UHD content is awesome.,2,2
"VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!",2,2
I highly recommend the Amazon Echo. The range of information and music are fun and help keep me up on current events.,2,2
"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.",2,0
"great little tablet for price, great if have amazon prime",2,2
"don't have a smart tv, so this fire tv is perfect for downloading Netflix, vudu, and any other apps. a must for tv watchers",2,2
This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!,2,2
"For me, the Amazon Fire TV is an amazing way to hook up with my favorite Netflix and Amazon Prime shows or explore other streaming sources. So easy to use. No more ""hunt and peck"" input for searching for the show I want to watch. I simply push a button, say the name of my fav show and it comes up on the screen. I love it so much, I bought one for both of my TV's!",2,2
We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.,2,2
I enjoy this product . I own 2 in addition to the fire sticks in the kids room.,2,2
store sales person was very helpful. price is always the bottom line.,2,2
"The Amazon - Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote is a great product. The setup is easy. I do advise you to set up an Amazon account prior to make the setup easy. I am an Amazon Prime Member, but it's not necessary to use the fireTV. I also purchased the fireTV stick for a 2nd bedroom. I will tell you though, the FireTV is worth the extra money. Not only is the FireTV still small, but it has 4k definition and you can use Ethernet and Wi-Fi. The biggest difference between this and the Fire Stick is that fireTv has expandable memory, excellent to add photos, apps, movies etc. The app store on the device also has games you can play on the fire tv and for an extra $40 you can get a remote that looks like an xbox controller.",2,2
"Love paperwhite version. Perfect to read at beach, at night ,on plane, etc...",2,2
The backlighting is great and it's much easier to read and turn the pages from the original Kindle. Highly recommended.,2,2
"I don't use echo as much as I thought I would, or should I suppose but it's a nice accessory to have. I have some trouble with it responding to my voice correctly but overall it works well.",2,2
Facinating product. A genius of a marketing tool for Amazon. Having a great deal of fun using Alexa.,2,2
"I bought this tablet for a gift for my nephew. It was a bargain on black Friday. I have not heard any complaints from my nephew yet.The only thing I did not like was the setup, it took too long.",2,1
"Amazed that with the Kindle Fire my kids are able to play games, view movies and read",2,2
"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter or companion tablet for watching videos, reading, internet browsing, and the like. If you have Amazon Prime, then you better get this!",2,2
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!",2,2
"I previously only had the dot until I got this one. This is so much better for listening to music, the weather report .. everything.",2,2
Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!,2,2
"Traded in the Echo for Google Home after trying both. Did the training questions but still found it could only answer 6 of 10 questions. There were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult. Google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question. Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality. Try them both before deciding what is best for your needs.",1,2
"Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket.",2,2
"navigation needs more work, no pointer feature sucks, definitely NOT a point-and-click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and needs replacedvoice alexa feature does NOT work inside apps to control the app, so careful what you say or needless purchases are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest ways to run kodi program direct to telly in HDMI tho.one can still load app for plex server for NAS playback via streaming, though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in es explore.its faster than old version, has Bluetooth 4.1 instead of 3.1, has a quad-core instead of dual-core processor, and doesn't seem to get hot after hours of play like old version did.But, If Amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex I would never buy an amazon product again tho.Not an amazon prime member and never will be, why pay for programming that I can get for free.",1,0
Nice product..Was difficult to figure out how to download books onto device. Could use better instructions. Once I figured it out it works really well.,2,2
We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.,2,2
It was the perfect Christmas present. Made everyone smile,2,2
Have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. Its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.,2,2
This is the latest kindle model and is just awesome. Highly recommended,2,2
It's ok. It does not have all the apps you might be looking for.,1,0
Good upgrade to the Firestick. Alexa search works well so you can quickly find titles.,2,2
Would definitely recommend very convenient and very quick and responsive,2,2
If is the easy to set up and use ...Got everything I wanted and more the speed of the tv box is great !!!,2,2
This thing has everything you need to watch movies and shows in 4K. I watch it almost everyday.,2,2
This is an ideal unit to use when cutting the cable from your provider. Very easy to install and there are great YouTube videos to get even more out of the unit.,2,2
"I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times.",2,2
Bery good product for the price. Can't beat it. Id recommend buying this for a first time tablet.,2,2
"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices.",2,2
Like the large screen for reading books and watching movies.,2,2
Great tablet starter for kids and also like that it comes in different colors,2,2
Bought for my wife and she loves it. Screen size is a huge plus. Easy to use I.,2,2
Overall this unit does everything it is advertised to do. It's hard to review something when it works exactly as described. I've had no issues.,2,2
You can keep watching your movie on the go if you have to leave the house.,2,2
"Took it on vacation & loved it! Read on the beach with no problems as the screen is bright & the font can be made as big as you need..Easy to download books too. If you're looking for just a great little, very portable reader I highly recommend this Kindle.",2,2
"Wish it could do more without subscribing to Amazion Prime. Bought this for my 19 year old daughter. She likes it a lot, but I think it could be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service.",2,2
My son loves his kindle! It was relatively inexpensive and he has dropped it multiple times and not a scratch!,2,2
"The Amazon Echo is very useful for all sorts of things, like playing music, telling the time, doing arithmatic calculations, etc. etc. Paired with a smart plug, you can tell it to turn lights on or off (for example.) All this is great fun and the Echo is adding new ""skills"" to its capabilities every day. The Echo has a decent speaker for music. Highly recommended!",2,2
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.,2,2
I purchased this kindle for my daughter inlaw for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!,2,2
Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.,2,2
I'm pleased with the Amazon Fire. It puts web browsing and a reader in a device that will fit in my purse. As a Black Friday special the price was almost 'too good to be true'.,2,2
We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!,2,2
"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person.",2,2
"With a high functioning WIFI and an Amazon Prime Account you have all of the personal functionality of a Pad of I. My kids use them, bang the heck out of them and they keep on ticking. They have destroyed 3 Ipads, so for a kid at home, it is very nice. -Borat",2,2
Pleased with my purchase.,2,2
this is my third or fourth one liked it so much got one for each of my grandchildren easy to use small enough for mom to carry in her purse or tuck away in the back seat pocket of the car and very durable,2,2
You will be amazed by the sound that comes out of this device. So easy to use and the voice activation allows me to change the station even from a distance. We plan on buying another one because our grown son has enjoyed ours so much .,2,2
"I bought one for myself and really liked it.Bought this one for wife, so far shes pleased.perfect size for purse and portability.",2,2
"This is a great little tablet. The price is right, and it offers a clear picture, with good speed for browsing the web. The interface with Amazon is perfect. Great for kids and adults too. Plenty of fun colors to choose from.",2,2
"Great apps!, Works great playing amazon movies! Very happy!",2,2
Works well. Like that Android apps can be sideloaded onto the device. Easy to set-up and use.,2,2
Better than anticipated. Would recommend. Can't wait for q battery operated version.,2,2
Love the ease of Alexa. Easy setu and has great sound.,2,2
Not the greatest small tablet and Amazon does have it locked down pretty well but it functions.,2,2
You get wath you paid not comparable to a apple tablet never,0,2
Received this as a gift and is very useful. Battery power stays for atleast a week. Does not strain my ryes.,2,2
Purchased as a gift for my son...He LOVES it!I may need to get one for myself.,2,2
"Gave the family the Echo for Christmas and we are still learning how it can be used. So far it is a hands free Siri, not a bad thing, that can be used by the whole family. It is an easy and fun way for us to learn about the IOT.",2,2
Some channels still glitchy but overall great hardware.,2,2
love this tablet! has a lot of apps for free and great hd screen,2,2
"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives.",2,2
"Got this included in a package deal with our Harmony Elite a few months back, and it has served as a decent add-on accessory throughout our home. We mainly use it as a bluetooth speaker for our mobile devices since the Amazon Prime Music library is pretty sparse, and Alexa isn't nearly as advanced as Siri in terms of answering questions. However, I was able to create a rule using Amazon's API that allowed me to link Google search. Alexa is also inconsistent with performing smart home tasks, but I'm sure this will improve over time. I wouldn't pay full price for this device, but I would recommend if you can find it on sale.",2,2
"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows",2,2
great tablet for the size. will be giving this to the kids from santa this year.,2,2
Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly,2,2
"It is a lot of fun and my grandkids have a ball with it . Even my 3 yrs old can talk to it , he has fun asking for songs.",2,2
Works great and fast. Just the right size for my work needs. Great Apps available.,2,2
We both got one and we enjoy it very much!! We both can read our books and play games it's great for traveling too. Have no complaints here.,2,2
Delivers on all counts. Lets me read anywhere I want and download easily from my local library digitally!,2,2
"Enjoyed this tablet. Easy to use, light weight to hold and good size carry in your purse",2,2
Love this kindle reader it is super easy to use and it has a long battery life!,2,2
It's a really good tablet for kids my kids love them,2,2
Purchased for my son works great and great price..,2,2
"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.",2,2
Love the paperwhite! no glare- easy to hold. The built in light is also great for night reading. I had the Kindle app on my Galaxy tablet but never used it because of the glare.,2,2
My kids loved it. They use it daily. I would recommend to any parent.,2,2
"When I picked up this product, I ordered 2 additional for Christmas. They sent me to the MOA store and said they are in stock. I received the text from Best Buy stating that they have been picked for me. Once I arrived they had one, but stated the other one had been sold. I asked if they could get another from another location and they simply stated that it was a popular item for Christmas and they are probably out of stock. After asking four times, I picked up the phone and called Duluth since the website stated that they had some. The store manager looked at me and decided I was serious about checking another store. I spoke with a rep in Duluth and he state that he just got off the phone with the manager of the MOA location and he was shipping one to MOA. So, I hung up the phone, about 5 minutes later the manager came back out to talk to me and he stated they didn't have anymore. I mentioned that I spoke with someone there and he spoke with the manager at MOA and was shipping it to him. The manager denied that he spoke with him. I requested someone from Best Buy leadership contact me and still have not heard from anyone at best Buy. The manager I dealt with at the MOA was Link.",2,0
"My wife gave this to me for Christmas and one for my daughter. For the money, I thought it wouldn't be worth it, but I was wrong. It is really way more powerful than I thought. I can do Word and Excel, PowerPoint, pdf's, work email, surf the Internet, movies, books, games...pretty much everything I thought I needed to spend 10X the money to get. I'm very surprised and happy with it. Only two I would change: a better picture and stop the ads on waking. This is a great value.",2,2
When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,1,1
Fantastic price. Large amount of app to choose from. Good parental controls. Helpful technical support. Of course don't expect this tablet to not getting slow when multiple apps are running in the background.,2,2
This is my 3rd kindle and my last-i'm moving on to something better!For me -following all packaging insert guidelines-they only lasted a year at the most.,0,2
"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it.",2,2
Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.,2,2
Fascinating device. Voice recognition is best yet. No irritating wise guy responses like Siri. Integrates spectacularly with Spotify Premium. Can't wait to get my back ordered Echo Dot for my sound system.,2,2
"I use this device to watch Playstation Vue and SlingTv, amazing device, it streams SlingTv more smoothly than my xbox one, also the quality of video hardly ever drops, if it does its my internet and not the device. Great for the price, 100% recommended.",2,2
got this for my mom and she loves it good for games or reading on,2,2
"I love being able to say ""Hey Alexa, play the Beatles"" and she plays a mix of my favorite songs. And not to mention playing Jeopardy every night!",2,2
very user friendly. my daughter has no problem navigating around to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime,2,2
Alexa is a blast. Had to go with it rather than google,2,2
"This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety.",2,2
The fact that it has parental control so I can verify what they are downloading is great,2,2
Better than Fire Stick. Great quality picture. Clarity with ultra hd.,2,2
I strongly recommend this item a lot of things to do,2,2
"This tablet is a great gift, specially if you have lil ones. They will be entertained for hours.",2,2
this is a very good product and is the better in the market thanks,2,2
Luv watching movies on the Amazon prime box.great price,2,2
Got this tablet for my daughter and she loved it again great tablet.,2,2
good sound quality and understand what you are asking without repeating yourself,2,2
Thinking that this would be just another gadget proved to be way off. The Amazon Echo has far exceeded our expectations! The sound is stellar and the timing is spot on!,2,2
"This is a great product, great for teenagers to read and play.",2,2
"Bought 5, 1 for each of my kids. So far so good. No issues with anything.",2,2
Works great. Less buffering than Fire TV Stick. Like the voice search on it.,2,2
Very fast and no problems loading apps onto the screen. Great price,2,2
"Upgraded from an older model AppleTV to this, couldnt be happier with the amount of features and apps available. Voice search is surprisingly great!",2,2
"Got two, one for each of my grand daughters. They love the portability and it allows them to both be up at the same time.",2,2
Bought this for my mom during Black Friday. The screen is big enough for her to watch her movies and play her games. She thinks it's so easy to use. She was using a little cracked screen phone before so she treasures this.,2,2
Purchased this for voice command capabilities which work great. Great product.,2,2
Amazon Kindle is a great product - I bought one as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it.,2,2
The fridge started to work earlier than indicated in the brochure,2,2
The Amazon Fire TV is simply awesome. I use it for HULU AND NETFLIX,2,2
"Bought this tablet for kids. Great price for what you get. Not as nice as the 7"" HD but price is right. Quick and responsive, would recommend for anyone looking for a tablet for child use. Parent controls are a nice touch.",2,2
This Kindle is so easy to use and the screen is very easy on the eyes!,2,2
"This product is the greatest thing.. Not only is it a speaker, but it is also a little computer at the palm of your hands. You can do so much with the Echo that we are having so much fun talking to her. There are little games you can play with her and she also has a variety of other things she can do. If you are on the fence about getting an Echo I wouldn't hesitate and run to the closest Best Buy and pick it up now. You will not regret it.",2,2
I already had an iPad and just bought this to see what all the fuss was about. Haven't used it hardly ever.,1,2
Lots of fun and educational- you can learn a lot and save the walking by talking to this device,2,2
This is good for the price battery is good quality of picture is ok,2,2
Its good for the price. Amazon store is not as huge as Android play store,1,2
"You aren't going to find a better tablet for this price. Loading non-amazon apps can be a pain and the OS is not the best, but it's great for games and reading.",2,2
The lighting makes this kindle the best I 've seen.,2,2
Pros: Look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader. The price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it. You might want to consider the upgraded Kindle Paperwhite with 300ppi if price is a concern.Cons: The Bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the Paperwhite.,2,2
Keyboard is a must for ease of use. Sometimes apps don't want to close.,2,2
I had a lot of eye strain issues when trying to read off of my i-pad and I just couldn't get comfortable while reading a book in bed. This purchased changed everything. I am now going through 4-5 books a month and I am doing so cheaply.,2,2
Easy to use! Reading clarity and background light/color is perfect. Lot's of free books to download and lot's of categories to choose from. You can also sample books that you would like to purchase..,2,2
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.,2,2
Very simple to set up and easy to use! If you are looking to start or add to your smart home this is the way to go!,2,2
I am happy with this streaming device. Easy to access and provide all the app that I am looking for.,2,2
good quality product will buy again best buy always has what i need,2,2
"Is there any better e-reader on the market? Not when you consider the overall quality and low price. This model has the same razor sharp resolution as the Voyage but with longer battery life. If you want a backlit e-reader, this is the one to buy.",2,2
We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.,0,2
"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.",2,2
We already saved money purchasing this and getting rid of direct tv monthly charges,2,2
My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!,2,2
I bought this to add voice control to my Smart Things lights and other devices. It was easy to integrate and works very well. Also purchased an Echo Dot for coverage in a second room.Only slightly disappointed that the assistant is not as smart as the Google app on my phone. Still pretty good though.,2,2
"Just does what it is supposed to do, Put together well and should hold up for years.",2,2
"Great price, used for my 6 year old daughter on a 12hr drive from texas. kept her busy. used mostly for games.",2,2
The amazon Fire tv is the best of all streaming devices a must have for Netflix,2,2
Simply great and easy to set up!!! I would recommend this to anybody.,2,2
This radio was bought at and then installed at Best Buy. They did an awesome job and it works great.,2,2
Love this Kindle. It's a great value for the price.,2,2
"Great value, does everything you want it to do. I would recommend to those who want a simple tablet experience.",2,2
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos",2,2
This device has a lot of good features. Once you pay for Amazon prime your able too watch a multitude of movies.,2,2
"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",1,2
Good if you like movies and have prime membership.,2,2
My special needs son frequently drops his tablet. This is a great low cost option when no protection case can hold him back.,2,2
"This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!.",2,2
"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use.",2,2
This is a wonderful tablet for the price. I do a lot with Kindle based books and the size is great for reading. That it has the ability to take a 128GB Micro SD card really makes this a steal for the price.,2,2
Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop.,2,2
"This is a great product. I downloaded tv apps like directv, HBO go, tnt, ESPN, etc. then I take it where ever I go, as long as I can get wifi, I won't miss a show or a movie. Fire stick is a little more travel friendly but this is faster between clicking on screens and had more internal memory (with option to add sdhc card)",2,2
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.,2,2
Bought this item for my nephew. Loves it. Recommend buying the rubber case also,2,2
The set up was easy and fast. Just plug and play. You even get one month of free service.,2,2
"I haven't really used mine that much, therefore I cannot rate it to its fullest. So far its been good.",1,2
"Easy to use, the only problem appears to be with the remote control. Seems like it stops working at least once a week.",2,2
Terrific purchase that was enabled with an Amazon Prime membership. We just love watching TV shows and movies in the privacy of our home using the Amazon Fire TV device. Simple to setup...less than 5 minutes and we were on our way.,2,2
I didnt realize how much i would actually use this thing. she does everything. my 10 year old uses it for school. i use it for everything else.,2,2
"I have two Google home devices. They seem to be lacking in smart5 home controls. Now I find out that additional devices are necessary to use Echo in a smarthome configuration. Although currently somewhat limited, I expect that Google home will surpass the Echo with addon smarthome devices. I'll wait, rather then buy these devices twice.",0,0
It's great to read in any kind of light. There is a tiny bit of bleeding at the top edge but nothing noticeable unless you are actively looking for inperfections. Makes reading easy and accessible in a light for factor.,2,2
"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker to use to play Amazon Music, and this product allows to to listen to music and do so much more. If you have an Amazon Prime account you'll enjoy this product.",2,2
Best buy had the best deal on this item. The echo is great and does that you can imagine.,2,2
We love this thing! And for only $50! It works perfect for quick netflix,2,2
Bought this mainly for my grandkids to play. The time limits you can set is great because they don't argue about who's on the most.,2,2
Love mine so far for reading. Good price and super easy to use.,2,2
I purchased this as a replacement for an original Kindle. It's a great reader that works everywhere.,2,2
"I do not use anything other than Exodus, so I see no difference between this and the firestick.",2,1
This version makes it incredibly easy to read. Much better than an iPad.,2,2
Great for reading on the go. Kid friendly. Easy to use.,2,2
"I don't have a smart home, but it does so much more than that! I got mine strictly for my own entertainment! I have not been disappointed! My daughter has a smart home and I got to see what it did for her. While controlling her lights and thermostat is nice, I am happy with playing my favorite songs. It will give me the forecast as I lie in bed! It sang me happy birthday!!!! I am still finding all of the neat things it can do!!!",2,2
Have had nothing but an amazing experience with it,2,2
My fire stick is one of the best electric devices I have ever bought.,2,2
"Great to search songs, check out news n weather. Ask information about a subject you are searching. Grandkids are forever playing with it!",2,2
Easy to set up. So far I like it. I added CBS All Acess to it and work great.,2,2
Bought for lil brother its a ok tablet for a kid especially apps like WWE and cartoon,1,2
I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.,2,2
"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera",2,2
Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!,2,2
Finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bells and whistles. Amazon has outdone it's self with this little gem.,2,2
"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain.",2,2
Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.,2,2
"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing.",2,2
"This is great for family use. For the price it was great. I can leave it out,and the children LOVE it. The TV is very lonely now.",2,2
"Easy to use, purchased it for a child! Great tablet for kids!",2,2
It's easier to read my books and stuff on this than my phone. Also had a micro SD card lying around to expand the storage.,2,2
"Really love the Echo. Have not learned how to use all the features, but really enjoy the ease of getting the music to play.",2,2
We got this for our 6 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.,2,2
Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.,2,2
"The Amazon tv works great! Fast loading, and no buffering. Works awesome with the Kodi app!",2,2
Great gift great price light weight battery lasts long time,2,2
"The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. Anything and everything you could imagine at your fingertips to watch. If you are on the fence about the purchase , I highly recommend this to anyone. It's a great item.",2,2
"We searched for months, wanting to cut our cable bill. Bought the Amazon Fire TV box. Amazon has their own programming and is adding more all the time. Also, downloaded a bunch of apps, and have been watching TED talks non-stop. Also bought an HD antenna for local channels, of which we get about 45. Deprogrammed the foreign language, shopping, preachers, and still left with about 35 which offer the 5 main broadcasters, and a LOT of 50s-70s repeats.",2,2
"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",1,0
"I bought this so that I could read in the bedroom without waking my infant, and without bright lights shining right in my eyes. I'm so glad I bought it! And the battery life is amazing!",2,2
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",2,2
"This is my second Echo. If you are NOT into home automation, the speaker is worth the price just as a speaker. However, if you have an amazon Prime membership, the Echo really shines with access to prime music and other Amazon services. It is also a good way to start into home automation. I personally have the wink Hub and Relays; Alexa (Echo´s Siri) integrates perfectly with Wink and IFTTT. I am placing Echos in rooms where I want Wireless music and the dots in the rest of the rooms to control my Smart devices from anywhere in the house.",2,2
Great tablet for the price. If you have Amazon prime it's even better,2,2
Very good product. Works well with all televisions.,2,2
I was tired of my cable bill being so high so I got the amazon Fire TV + Digital antenna. This is a great alternative to Cable TV.,2,2
Can't say enough good things about this product. Very happy with the way that Alexa integrates into my life. Well designed and well executed. I'm waiting for Amazon Dot's to put around my home.,2,2
This gives me so many app and avenues to watch and stream directly.,2,2
"I purchased the echo for 179.00, it is no on sale for 139.00. My friend bought one at home depot and they gave $40.00 refund. I had mine for 3 weeks but Best Buy would not give me a refund. Alexia is working great. I am going to buy me the smaller echo. At Bed Bath And beyond I get 20% 0ff. At home depot I get 10% off.",2,0
I really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous Kindle reader like the previous Kindle readerI dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous Kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown,2,2
Easy to read. Great for travel. Has been an excellent purchase.,2,2
Still needs more compatability for things it controls. Needs some sort of access to maps,2,2
My previous kindle's home page was more intuitive than the Paperwhite I just bought,2,2
"I like this tablet a lot. I now own 3 of them and feel good that I can have one close to the tv. If I step on it and crush it I am only out a few bucks. It is clearly not as nice as my ipad, but I can get 10 of these for what one I device costs. I use it to watch tv, read, and surf the web. As a sports fan, sometimes I line all three up so I can watch three games at once.",2,2
I love the Echo Alexa is great the features make life easier especially with all the compalibility options there are,2,2
Really enjoying our Echo; listening to music and using for alarm and reminders,2,2
"Amazing fire TV is simple, works seamlessly. I like the streaming speed, and cache on the device. Amazon has lot choices interms of movie. Big bang for your buck.",2,2
I like the tablet. It is pretty awesome. Easy to use and you can download lots of free games that you couldn't download for free on other devices and underground Amazon is the reason why.,2,2
this product was amazingly fast n has made my smart tv even better,2,2
I started out looking for an iPhone 7 Plus. My company wanted my iPhone 7 and $400. I looked into tablets and found this wonderfully sized Kindle. It does everything a phone or a tablet does for a fraction of the money. I love mine.,2,2
Alexa is ready quickly and very easy to use. Accurate information and good sound quality,2,2
Sales guy didn't have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn't very helpful in getting me started.,2,2
She loves it and it's easy for her to use. Perfect for the younger child growing into adulthood.,2,2
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON TO USE TO WATCH VIDEOS & PLAY GAMES. I HAVEN'T BEEN DISSAPOINTED AT ALL SO FAR. MONEY WELL SPENT.,2,0
"I bought the Amazon Fire TV about a month ago. I reviewed the Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast. This one was rated the highest and i haven't been disappointed. I also have the Apple TV. It was more and difficult to operate for my wife.",2,0
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases,2,2
Great product. Great value. Worth every penny. Ads do not interrupt reading or alter the experience significantly.,2,2
"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!",0,2
Fathers day present. Really enjoy Alexa. Works great and comes in handy by the kitchen.,2,2
we love this fire box.It gets all of the channels and even new movies that are still in the theater,2,2
"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it.",2,2
Does everything we expected! Great for the price. Had it over a month now and no problems. I'd recommend it!,2,2
"The Amazon Echo is a great way to be entertained and stay well informed! Thanks to technology you can ask Alexa, questions and because it's a blue tooth speaker you can play your music in a stylish way!",2,2
"I bought this as a Birthday gift for my son. He saw videos about it and fell in love with it. Once we plugged the Echo in, it was an instant hit in the home! Setup is simple and Alex is ready to assist in moments. Amazon hit the nail on the head with this one.",2,2
My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!,2,2
"I am really happy with my Echo. So far it has been very easy to use, although we havent completely figured out all the functions. It was fairly easy to set up.",2,2
Easy set up. Very easy to use. Was easy to install.,2,2
"Bought one of these to get something to try out Kodi, as a streaming media device it works really well. I love the fact you can have your Netflix and other apps right at hand, I can still run plex and Kodi installs In a matter of minutes. Nice to have a single device to run all my needs and totally replaced the need for cable. The sticks work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend.",2,2
There are no words except greatest thing created! We use this thing every single day! We watch old and new movies and tv shows!,2,2
"Great for playing music, asking questions, and playing around. You will discover new uses for it every week.",2,2
"the Kindle Voyage is the very best ereader that I've ever used. The light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all (iPads, Fire and Nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading) while providing light read by. The controls are simple and easy to learn. However it is slightly pricey. For me the quality and relief are well worth the price.",2,2
Bought 2 for our grand kids Great price and very good graphics,2,2
"Decent price for a nice tablet. Got it for Kids, I set it up and got ready to go, kids love it and spend time playing their fave apps.",2,2
"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my wife. I have always loved the Kindle products. This is her first Paperwhite and we are incredibly pleased with it. Very lightweight, the touchscreen aspect doesn't get in the way of things, and the backlight doesn't compromise the e-ink quality of feeling like reading on paper.",2,2
Our kids ranging from 4-12 like this product. It's very versatile for all ages,2,2
"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.",2,2
It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!,2,2
It great daughter loves it! She loves how fast it is,2,2
"I used a couple of the brands that are just priced under this product and well...you get what you pay for! This tablet was much easier for my granddaughter to learn on. She can access her camera, pictures, videos, and games, much better than the ""other brand"".",2,2
This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.,2,2
Kindle paperwhite reader is great. Easy way to buy books.,2,2
I love this device. I love learning all the stuff it can do and I look forward learning what Amazon is going to do to improve it in the future.,2,2
This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,1,2
I use my Echo everyday! When I want to listen to music or just one song it will play it. I use it for the kitchen a lot! When I want a kitchen timer it works perfect. We will get a group and play games with the Echo also. It is a great overall addition to a home.,2,2
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,2
The Echo is an excellent product and gives out excellent clear loud sound. This was a great buy! You can ask Alexa to do anything from songs to buy on Amazon etc. thanks best buy for all your help!,2,2
"Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough.",2,2
This ia a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment.,2,2
Bought the new for Father's Day. Works well sometimes have to reset it to connect to Internet. All the apps are easy to access.,2,2
Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!,2,2
"works as described, but still needs some improvements such as more languages, more convenient menu... overall, it is one of the best TV boxes in the market now.",2,2
I bought this for my room but my teenagers wint let me use it. They live. I'm thinking about getting another for myself,2,2
This product does more than I thought. Outstanding.,2,2
"Tried Voyage and Paperwhite. I like Paperwhite, why to spend more.",2,2
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!",2,2
Great product a like a lot .works perfect in any tv,2,2
Good for searching the web & email. Good game apps. A bit disappointed that I don't have access to apps thru google & some videos will not play.,2,2
Got it as a Christmas present. Recipient enjoys It very much.,2,2
This box was definitely worth the upgrade than the stick. It's snappier and easy to install programs on.,2,2
"I decided to cut the cable and bought Amazon fire tv. That along with a high definition antenna is all I need. So easy to set up and use. Tons of apps to choose from and I love Alexi. I simply tell her what show I want, she searches through all the apps and shows me where it is. How simple is that? Love it.",2,2
"This thing is awesome. It plays my music, turns on my lights and cools my home all by way of my cell phone. I couldn't ask for more.",2,2
My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.,2,2
Purchased for grandchildren and they love it. They are five years old.,2,2
Absolutely amazing. A must have for the home and Ethernet connection makes internet connection fast and reliable,2,2

We have 2 fire sticks and 1 fire TV. This is a great into. Love the voice search remote. NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS APPLE ITUNES.You will not be able to stream Vudu and Apple on this device. Recommended. We are Amazon Prime which I also highly recommend to maximize value for this product.,2,2

Purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. She loves it. Great product.,2,2
I think this is one of the better streaming devices,2,2
I have 2 FireTV boxes and 2 Fire Sticks and love them both. The sticks buffer a bit sometimes but the box never does for us. I use it with Playstation Vue and it works great!,2,2
Unreal black Friday deal on a great product. Wish there were more like it.,2,2
Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.,2,2
"I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product.",2,2
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),2,2
"Good battery life, Good screen clarity, Easy to use.",2,2
"Its a good product within this price range. Though the processing is not very fast but its ok for this price. For me, i bought it for my 2.5 year old son who just want to view video's and try out some basic stuff. So good to start for a beginner.",2,2
This is our second Amazon Fire TV. They are great and we've never had any issues with it. We really love the Amazon Prime membership as well.,2,2
"Excellent price, good quality, you can't ask more for so little money.",2,2
We actually bought these for our summer camp program and the kids love them. They small enough for their hands to carry and they work like a charm. The staff was super helpful.,2,2

It's a really good thing to have a round the house,2,2
Love this TV box does everything and even more. Everyone needs one.,2,2
I am really enjoying being able to read books online that are downloaded from the public library. I have read 5 books in the last few weeks now that I can use the public library system to access book titles. No more buying books at the bookstore,2,2
"THIS IS EASY TO USE, I ALSO HAVE A ROKU AND I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER. IT TOOK ME A FEW MINUTES TO GET USE TO THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ROKU REMOTE TO THE FIRE REMOTE, BUT NOW IT AWESOME",2,0
Got this for a great deal during Black Friday sale for my small children. I already have Amazon Prime so I get all their shows & movies streaming on the tablet. A great kids' babysitter for one-time cost of $33.,2,2
This is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! Gets everything done that I need it to,2,2
"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK.",2,0
I love streaming tv with this device works very smoothly have had no glitches whatsoever,2,2
I love this speaker so much! This speaker has outperformed every other speaker I have purchased! Alexa has great voice recognition and kicks Siri's butt it in this area!,2,2
Love Alexa! She is very informative and works my lights and plays my favorite music!! I highly recommend this to everyone!,2,2
Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.,2,2
Is easy and nice tablet. I love it... I can share my account with my husband.,2,2
Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,2,2
Love my new reader. It took a while to sort out all of the functions as it is quite different from my old Kindle. Now however it goes with me everywhere. I especially like the back light that makes reading always easy.,2,2
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.,0,2
Love this device!! Easy to set up and fun to use. Highly recommend.,2,2
Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes,2,2
I really love this product. I like to order products why talking to Alexa. HAHA!!,2,2
"Love talking to Alexa to tell it to control temp, what to play , what to mix",1,2
Alexa Is a very good product. Great speaker volumne for lidten to music and a lot of apps for it,2,2
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.,2,2
all around great speaker would definitly recommend,2,2
I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!,2,2
I got this for my wife. With a little help from our daughter we got it set up. So far so good.,2,2
Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer,2,2
My wife and I love the Amazon Echo. It is very easy to use.,2,2
This tablet cannot be beat for the price we paid. Just wish I would have purchased one that was bigger.,2,2
Very easy to use. A high quality apple product. Good tech!,2,2
I love to read and I find by downloading books on my kindle is so easy. I love it.,2,2
Don't expect too muchbfor the money you paid for this tab. Easy to carry and very hard to break .,2,2
"The price was right, and my grandkids love them! I now own 4 of them, they are simple enough for Grandma to work.",2,2
"Can't beat kindle fire, already have 2 and got 2 more Thanksgiving sale for $33!!!",2,2
"I bought 2 of these and they were both Christmas gifts (1) for my daughter and (1) for her daughter. The price was great ! Now, how do I let you know who the owners are and how they can set them up in their names?",2,2
some channels don't come in as clear as others but most are pretty good,2,2
This is a great tablet for the price. It comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. Don't miss this deal!,2,2
"Fast,reliable, and has everything you need!!! Use Kodi for free everything you'll want to get rid of cable/satellite ASAP",2,2
After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.,0,0
Is this the best Wi-fi speaker in this price range? No. Is it the coolest? Absolutely. The echo is easily one of the most unique gadgets I have in my house right now. It's pretty cool as a stand alone speaker but way cooler considering the smart capabilities of this device. My favorite part about the echo is that as time goes on it gets better not worse thanks to new skills being developed on a regular basis. The only complaint I would have with this speaker is that at high volumes the low end gets very distorted.,2,2
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.,2,0
This is a great product. It works great and is fun to use.,2,2
First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.,2,2
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market.",2,2
The the price and size it works well my mother loves it,2,2
Bought this to view movies and shows online - worked out pretty good so far!,2,2
Read a lot about my product and would only purchase at Best Buy,2,2
"This is a great tablet, if you keep your expectations in check. Is it going to rival the likes of the iPad or even the 2013 Nexus 7? No. But there is a lot of junk in the $50-100 tablet market. Thankfully the new Kindle Fire isn't one of these. The screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube, netflix, and hulu. I had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. If you can find it when it is on sale for $39.99, it's an even bigger steal.",2,2
good add thirt party app watch chinese tv.speed fast .and stady.,2,2
MY KIDS BOUGHT THIS FOR ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.,2,2
Great little tablet I gave as a gift to my mom. She is not tech savvy at all and she seems to have no real issues using it.,2,2
"Bought these for Christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! The kids and adults loved them. The adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also.",2,2
"I now have 3 Bedroom,kitchen and shower area and I will be getting one for the media room in the future. I think that says it all. The only down side is since it's operations is in the cloud, if Amazons servers go down then it's a brick but you can connect to Bluetooth on the phone and also use it as a Bluetooth speaker. There is one thing they could fix and that is when the volume is up high then if you try to talk to the Echo, it can't hear you and you'll have to manually turn it down.",2,2
Very affordable and very easy to set up. It has great features. Makes you use your phone lesser.,2,2
I am in love with the tablet. It is a perfect tablet for me to use at home and on the road for basic internet tasks. I am able to download apps and also use it as a reader. I love it!,2,2
His amazon echo is a must for a smart home Apliance.,2,2
Easy to set up and works great right out of the boa,2,2
"Love Fire TV. I have since cut cable, with the exception of my internet connection, and have no regrets. I get more channels through streaming media apps. and at cheaper prices. The menu is also user friendly. The remote is excellent, as is the voice commands options. You won't regret purchasing Fire TV.",2,2
Works as advertised. Will be interesting to see that additional apps that Amazon rolls out for the Fire device.,2,2
"Easy setup , when you install very very easy, good",2,2
Quick starting and easy to use. This tablet is great for travel and games at night. E-mail checks are a snap. Low cost makes it something you do not need to worry about. Even supports e print to my HP printer. Buy 2 and enjoy it. No downside found yet.,2,2
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law on thanks giving and this is the best gift...They just love it to the best,2,2
"I love the free time application you can set it to, but don't care for the ads that always come up.",2,2
"I received the Dot as a gift and didn't even want one but I set it up and WOW! I was blown away with this little ""hockey puck"", device! Now this is coming from someone who still has a full stereo/phonograph system in the corner in a cabinet, but has not had it hooked up in years...just because. I did play music once in a while through Pandora on the tv but that's it. I liked the convenience of the dot and what it could do so much I took it bach and got the Echo and I like it a lot.",2,2
My family and I enjoy spending time together watching movies for relaxation and entertainment. The Amazon product has been easy to use.,2,2
I'm happy with the latest edition of the Amazon Fire TV. Uses Amazon's digital services seamlessly and has good app support.,2,2
Cool,2,2
"Love this item, kindle with the light is so totally worth it",2,2
purchased this to supplement my larger tablet perfect size for smaller bag.,2,2
Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.,2,2
"This tablet was good enough for reading, check email and watch some movies on internet. It doesn't has a lot of option for free app as Samsung or Apple devices.",2,2
"love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone",2,2
"Great tablet for kids, inexpensive and reliable. Sturdy and kid friendly.",2,2
If your not sure of what your needs are..The Fire is a good place to start..,2,2
"This replaced an original iPad , Great Price and performance",2,2
"Really enjoy the echo. Can ask it just about anything. Has great speaker sound, love listening to my music on it. Excellent product. Glad i purchased it.",2,2
This makes it so much better to charge the kindle. It's small and easy to put in a case along with the cord and kindle.,2,2
The fire tv is super easy to use an super fast compared to the fire stick. Easy setup an all.,2,2
Its a greatproduct halpy i bought and im happy to use it,2,2
I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.,2,2

"This is a great product. My wife says it's my new girlfriend. It works with so many apps I have, Our Groceries, Wemo my Honeywell thermostat.I liked it so much my wife bought me the Amazon Dot for my birthday.",2,2
Great box for Playstation Vue and Kodi. Works great and easy to set up.,2,2
I bought this for my living room Tv works great. No issues what so ever.,2,2
"I have the Echo, Echo Dot and both work excellent with my Wink Hub and Nest thermostat. No complaints so far.",2,2
Ok I would not be recomend this product at all okk,2,0
It works perfectly and I like it . I might get another one for Christmas gift,2,2
"This is a gift for friend, and she loves that! She told me this device helped her with concentration when read.",2,2
"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate.",2,2
"Amazon products are always great products! This time, the pricing was very competitive and reasonable.",2,2
The camera not quality pictures but all else great,2,2
"Used several TV box before, and amazon fire TV's major pros is the root privilege to install app. So far so good. Quickly delivery!",2,2
"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help",2,2
"As an Amazon prime member I figured this would be cool to play my Amazon Prime music, but it's also a Bluetooth speaker that I can play My XM radio or iTunes through. Alexa is getting smarter and know my voice better with every question. She has my appointments and traffic and weather covered every morning. Great item here and great sounding speaker.",2,2
This is the first tab my niece is using and she is just loving it,2,2
I already have kindle 7 hdx love it. So I got this cheaper one for my son. He uses it to watch movies etc. Works great.,2,2
Endless number of titles to choose from at a very reasonable price. This e-reader is a great value.,2,2
"This tablet is so great. It's easy to use, the price tag is amazing! The App Store has a great selection. I would recommend to just about anyone.",2,2
This is amazons cheapest tablet and probably oldest in the market. Good for the price.,2,2
This Kindle works great for reading outdoors in daylight and can also download books using the Wi-Fi from the device.,2,2
I love the Amazon Echo because it is so interactive. Alexa responds to your commands and the speakers are excellent.,2,2
Purchased two of these as gifts for Christmas. No complaints.,2,2
Decent tablet for the price. Expect just basic use and function. This is no iPad be sure you aren't expecting that.,1,2
It was great for my 73 year old mother.She uses it for the Bible.,2,2
"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time",2,2
I got this for my mom who wanted to cut down on her cable bill. It has worked great!,2,2
"The flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensors is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Reader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed.",2,2
It was easy to setup. The kids love it! Pretty good battery life.,2,2
"The tablet was a gift and we are very happy with the standard options on the tablet. It's easy to use ,has a camera and is a great size .",2,2
"If you don't have an echo or never played with one, you will be in for a treat. Words can't describe how much I love this thing. It controls home automated devices, finds information such as recipes, can do shopping for you, find reviews on products, play music, tell jokes, and so much more. I want one for every room. Now it will do phone calls and voice texting to people who have Alexa devices. The phone call on my weak internet was flawless.",2,2
"2nd kindle liked the first one better space bar located to close to change menu icons download is slow and have great internet service, device freezes up a lot and have to shut down and reboot, must close out any open tab to open a new one one happy with this model",1,2
This was a perfect gift for my son for Christmas of 2015,2,2
"Echo is fun for the family. You can play music, games, get news and weather.",2,2
I like the fact you can talk to the device. More convenient than the others.,2,2
Great product for those interested in a simple e-reader and don't need to stream video.,2,2
"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",2,2
This device is amazing. It has all the latest tv apps as well as cable channel apps. It definitely will cut your cable bill in half,2,2
"Bought as gift, don't know the details, but kids love be it!",1,2
"It's fast, content is great and as long as no HDR isn't an issue, it's a great alternative to the Shield at half the price.",2,2
I like this!! Its pretty cool it has a huge music library,2,2
I love my Kindle. It's fast and very convenient to carry around.,2,2
Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!,2,2
I got this for my mom. I have a Kindle and there are always free games available for it but not for the tablet she had so i got it for her and download a bunch of games for it. The only problem is the games seem to drain the battery fairly quickly,2,2
I have 'Alexa' in the living room. Each morning I ask her the weather forecast and plan my day. If I need to go out I ask her the traffic conditions. While watching television I can always get inside information on shows as well as the actors and actresses. While playing cards with friends and family 'Alexa always finds the right background music for us. This is a great product!,2,2
We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using.,2,2
My second Kindle and I was really glad to see that I didn't lose all my photos and books.,2,2
"Thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that lasts! Enjoy the ease of navigating the apps. Good picture, and sound.",2,2
"Pro -Inexpensive, compact device.Con - lack of protective covers",2,2
Love my Amazon Fire tablet because it's not too small and not too big. It's just the right size. It's light weight and the resolution is very good. I recommend it highly.,2,2
Great device! Fast response with remote control. Great voice recognition! Very reliable in terms of connectivity. Streaming 4k is a big plus. Overall great product.,2,2
"Has a great processor for its size, it's robust with lots of features and has a wonderful small remote that fits nicely in your hand. The remote has much fewer buttons then your standard remotes, which makes its very simply to use and along with Amazon GUI interface makes its simple to get around. I had other products that it competes with and this is by far the best, easier device to get around with.",2,2
"Great tablet for my grandchildren. It's sturdy and they can do many things on the tablet. Watch movies, listen to music, play games and text.",2,2
"Gave it to my mom, who hasn't turned on a computer in 20 years. Showed her a couple of things, now she is a pro.",2,2
"I'm not sure this device would have gotten much use if I didn't have any home automation devices. It is very continent to ask Alexa to turn off certain lights, set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger events through IFTTT. I really don't use any of the other features like creating lists or scheduling events, but I do use the timer function while I am in the kitchen.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 -Other devices cannot utilize my Echo's speaker, I would like for SmartThings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walks through a main entry door, or if my garage door opens, which I know other Wi-Fi connected speakers are capable of doing.Echo to Echo connectivity would also be a nice feature, being able to say ""Play music in all rooms"" or while standing in the kitchen ""Play music in the living room""",2,0
Alexa has been amusing and informative to say the least. She is a wealth of information. She saves time and energy also.,2,2
It's a great tablet for my kids at their age. I recommend it to anybody looking for one.,2,2
This fun device has changed our viewing habit. The diversity is great.,2,2
"Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching amazon prime ,YouTube or just checking face book or any other chats. Love to play games. The family loves it all.",2,2
Generally it is good. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond well.,2,2
I listen to my favorite music and podcasts with surprisingly good sound.,2,2
"I purchased this for my fiancé. She reads books with it,surfs the web, and watches Netflix on it. Very easy set up and easy to use. It also comes in different colors.",2,2
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.,2,2
"love it, great hd, smooth streaming with sd card--I've bought 3 as gifts and one for myself I like them so much",2,2
"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2.",0,0
Enjoy the fire kindle and would recommend to people,2,2
Bought two for the kids. They are very happy. My only problem it that I have not been able to download movies to the SD card. I keep getting a message saying that the Kindle does not support it.,2,2
"kid love this, it can use for multipurpose game, video......",2,2
Its a good product but the OS is kind of slow.Also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disconnect itself.,2,2
I've been using it for a while and can say that watching 4k streaming movies and shows are awesome.,2,2
"Excellent product for the price. Larger screen , light weight. Easy to download apps",2,2
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.,2,2
Buy it. These are awesome. Love them! So much can be done with them. Best on the market. Worth the extra over the fire tv stick.,2,2
Easy to use...long cord.,2,2
My grand daughter wanted a tablet and this was a wonderful purchase for her birthday. The price was excellent and it does everything she was looking for and more. She never wants to put it down!,2,2
These are better for kids instead of those fancy and costly kid tablets if you set these up with right content they need. Resolution is not great though. You get what you pay for.,2,2
Great product for watching movies or using with kodi doesn't heat up as quickly as the smaller firestick,2,2
I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.,2,2
Got this for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it,2,2
"Best value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. It's a shame Apple hasn't caught on to the needs of parents when it comes to digital media.",2,2
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.,2,2
Good product. I will recommend this product because it is an amazing voice controlled item which does way more than you can imagine. The speakers are also loud for the size,2,2
"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product.",2,2
we got it in a deal of the day and gifted to my friend. HE is happy about this product,2,2
Very light very well made feels durable Easy to use everything Amazon,2,2
"The Kindle Fire is nice to use as a tablet to play games and surf the web as well as download and read books on. It has good speed, keeps a good charge and is affordable.",2,2
Very easy to use. Great for putting music on to use with wireless speaker,2,2
Excellent alternative to paying the big companies a bunch of money.,2,2
"For the price this is a great value, I considered a laptop, or larger tablets but am quite satisfied with this purchase",2,2
"Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it",2,2
Easy to use and similar to using a book. Love it! I would buy again!,2,2
"We got this tablet for my aunt so she could read, check emails, and play games. It is very easy to setup and use for anyone!",2,2
Love to read and this little thing is perfect. I carry it everywhere. I read all the reviews and was on the fence since I used my phone or Kindle Fire to read but the lighting on the paperwhite is so much better for my eyes and the size is great.. Love this and highly recommend.,2,2
My daughter loves it and so does my son and wife too.,2,2
"The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those.",0,0
"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price.",2,2
"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others.",2,2
I got the Amazon Echo for my SIL for a Christmas gift and everyone in the family was jealous. They all want one! Purchasing it at Best Buy was easy and the best way to go since this was a popular item this year.,2,2
Love this echo well worth the price. No complaints,2,2
"Amazing tablet, does everything I need it for and upgrade tricks to make it even better. I like this tablet and all I can do with it...watch my shows, stream music, browse the internet and read my favorite books and comics.",2,2
"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!",2,2
Tablet work like charm and I never have issues with it,2,2
Never have a problem with my kindle fire got 4 of them,2,2
The Echo does everything it is advertised to do. Mine does things without a hitch that others have a problem with. Mine does lighting through my alarm system in a few simple steps. Works great!,2,2
This tablet works just as well as the big name one at half the price,2,2
"Even though I own both an iPad Pro and an iPad Mini, this is my preferred e-reading device. It's light and the battery lasts a good ten times longer than my iDevices.",2,2
We love Alexa!!! Awesome speaker! We have recommended to many friends and family!,2,2
"Good tablet for a travel companion. Good for playing games, streaming movies and as a reading tablet. Can add other apps as well. .",2,2
I enjoy the my Amazon Echo so much I purchased a Dot for my bathroom.,2,2
Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.,2,2
This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate,2,2
I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.,2,2
"I love getting weather, trivia and Music all from one sleek source.",2,2
"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do.",2,2
this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...,2,2
Its a great tablet for a low price. There are thousands of apps and electronic books to read.,2,2
Fun and easy to use. My son loves for Alexa to tell him jokes.,2,2
Was3nt used to an Amazon was used to android.this product is good just wasent used to it,0,2
Great product built structurally solid no issue and purchased 2.,2,2
Good interface but not as good as the Apple TV. I got it so we can get our cable TV app on our TV.,2,2
"With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time.",2,2
"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!",2,2
The best product that I've ever watched a movie on I love the Amazon tablet it's does amazing things,2,2
"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear.",2,2
This works just as advertised. Wonderful to use this in an another room.,2,2
The Amazon Echo is a very nice addition. It's kind of like Siri without the need to hold a phone. I have it paired with my WeMo switches and so far it works great!,2,2
"If you want to stream video and use Kodi. This is the one to get. I bought this especially for the fact I could hard wire it to my router. No video pausing, skipping etc. Works great.",2,2
"I love the picture, easy to navigate, light weight and easy travel size . I bought 4 for Christmas presents.",2,2
"I had a kindle fire 3rd gen and I liked it a lot, but this one is better. I like the SD card slot for extra memory or to move pics from camera to kindle, book reading is great, I don't do many videos, but those I have watched seem to be fine. Graphics are good. Small enough to fit in my bag on the go, but big enough that I am able to type easily. Would recommend.",2,2
It's great and always getting better. I have three now. I listen to audiobooks constantly and use the white noise options while I sleep.,2,2
"Had the kindle 7th gen with no backlight and upgraded to the paperwhite. Was one of the best decisions I've made. You don't even notice that there IS a backlight because it blends in so well, and compared to the 7th gen is a night-and-day difference. Buy this, you will not regret it.",2,2
Boys gift to their mother for mother's day. She was thrilled to get it and still enjoys it. Great!,2,2
"I've purchased several kindles over the years & this is the only one that has given me issues. Purchased this one & exchanged it. I Eventually exchanged the exchange for the same reason. The first two kindles didn't want to turn on & would freeze. So far this one hasn't had any issues what so ever & does everything my mother needs it for (downloading thousands of books & watching videos non-stop)Docked a star due to complications with the first two. If I have to visit a store within the first month of a purchase twice, that is an issue.",2,0
"The fire stick has more than enough to offer in entertainment, something for every one's taste. The programming is not disappointing. The equipment is inexpensive and you.have control of any other expenses like subscriptions. Your bill will be far less than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the programs. The only thing that needs to be done is having local channels available,. without an antenna which may or may not help reception.. I also miss OWN.",2,2
"I have the Fire Stick and added the Fire TV. The Fire TV is noticeable faster than the Fire Stick and more reliable. If you like the Amazon interface, which I do, go for the speed.",2,2
Bought to keep the kiddo entertained. Works perfect. Tons of free games.,2,2
"Love the tablet, my 4 year old uses the tablet on a daily basis! Perfect tablet for kids!",2,2
I wanted a portable speaker that worked with Amazon prime music. There is nothing in the market right now that does that except for the Tap. For the $100 price its fine. I would rather spend $200 and get a better sound quality speaker though since it will be used outside as well as is in the kitchen.,2,2
Love the Amazon Fire TV line. I have fire sticks and the Fire TV for my parents. Both are great and easy to use. Nice set up and the ability to add memory is a great feature for gaming or for heave app users. Very convenient to have.,2,2
"The product overall is great. I got it as a Christmas present for my mom and she loved it.The only problem I had was with ordering. I was unexpected put on backorder when a Best Buy employee had stated and showed me I would receive the product the Tuesday after Christmas. Fortunately, I found the product in another Best Buy store and canceled my back order of the product. Great product overall, but 4 stars from me because this was the first time Best Buy ever let me down like that so I hope it doesn't happen again.",2,2
Perfect size for travel so kids can be entertained in the car and checking emails and watching shows and reading e-books very convenient for mom's on the go. worth the every cent,2,2
Not as good as the HDX but does well for $50. Also much slower than HDX. Screen is more pixelated than anticipated. Would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.,1,0
Excellent product. Simplifies wifi television viewing.,2,2
"I have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv, the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs. It's very quick with minimal lagging. If you have a decent IP you will be very satisfied with this product!",2,2
"We bought these kindles for a gift for the kids on Black Friday. The price was amazing and they are durable. I know we will get our money out of them. I love that there is parental control, you can password protect areas where you don't want the kids to discover yet. Overall, great value for the price.",2,2
My 6 year old grandson navigates on the tablet with ease. He's even taught me some things.,2,2
Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it,2,2
Saved on cable bill and bought this on sale at best buy. Great device! Its better than roku and the google chrome.,2,2
It has some learning to do but its great to have it play my amazon music anywhere.,2,2
One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.,0,0
Got this for my nephew for Christmas and he hasn't put it down :) he loves it,2,2
Was given to my husband as a gift. He loves it. Said it was a great gift. Purchase it at a great price.,2,2
I like my echo because of the things it can do/tell me.,2,2
Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.,2,2
fire tv offers so many more channels to watch. Give you more than you ever had,2,2
"The tablet is okay, I mean it does the job. However, the wifi is really spotty. We even changed the wifi password (based on a YouTube video) to ensure that it works..but it keeps going in and out",1,0
"This is a great product, the cost is incredible and proves other manufacturers prices are inflated.",2,2
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.,2,2
My son really likes the kindle fire and it so easy for him to use,2,2
"If you like to read books, I totally recommend this product. I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go.  There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books.",2,2
great tablet for the price easy to use and came very quick,2,2
Source of information and entertainment for the whole family! Would definitely recommend.,2,2
THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR A 15 YEAR OLD. IT IS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDED.,1,0
She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school,2,2
"I got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. It has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. He doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated.",2,2
"Super light, the paper white is a huge success and the battery life is as advertised. However, it is so light and small it mandates a protective case-BUT they are never in stock or otherwise available.",2,2
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.,2,2
We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.,2,2
This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added.,2,2
I bought this for quick reports about latest news and for playing music.I tred for 2 days with help from Amazon technical services To hard to understand Tech. Had to send back and get a new one. Google home much easier to set up took only 5 mins.,2,2
Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.,2,2
I bought four of these for.my kids for xmas. They haven't put them dwn willingly yet! I think it was a great deal for a great product!,2,2
It's alright personally the picture quality is pretty bad but I guess that's what you get for paying 50.,2,0
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds.",2,2
Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment,2,2
Good picture for video and reading. Wish amazon would expand app store or use Google play,2,2
my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy,2,2
I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.,2,2
Was a gift. The receiver really enjoys it and was an upgrade from her previous kindle,2,2
Very easy to setup. The navigation through the system is very simple. Great product,2,2
"This little box gives you endless TV episodes, tons of movies, 5 million songs, And Photo storage and display when linked to an Amazon prime account. It also allows you to get apps from all over the place and even play games. I am also streaming live TV with Vue thru this little tiny, shiny, black box. I am impressed.",2,2
Can not beat the quality of the product for the cost.,2,2
"Light weight, great upgrades from the paperwhite. Love it!",2,2
I bought this to replace my Kindle touch. Since Kindle's no longer have speaker options. It's good for reading but to small to be used as a primary tool.,2,2
I liked this item so much that I purchased 2 more as Xmas presents.,2,2
"It is little slow at start up. But once its up. it works great. For the price, it is a great device. I play basic games, they run smoothly.",2,2
This was a perfect fit for my in-laws. Their lack of knowledge with tech made this the perfect gift,2,2
Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.,2,2
I'am having a lot of fun with the Amozon echo there is so much to learn i get email letting me know what she has learned and up dates The sound was really amazing for something so small,2,2
I had no Idea that this device would be so much fun to use. It's not an iPad mini but in many respects works just as well. It is the best $50 I've ever spent. I was able to root this tablet and install a custom rom which makes this even better. Its nice to know that you do not have to spend a fortune for a big name brand device to get the same quality Android experience.,2,2
"Works well - I used to have Kindle and Nook on my tablet, but find having the Kindle separate so much better. Holds a charge a long time and easier to tuck in my purse and take with me.",2,2
"I bought the Amazon Fire with realistic expectations. I have an iPhone SE (outstanding phone), so the intention was to be able to play some free games, view Facebook/etc on a slightly larger screen, some light web browsing, and maybe read an electronic book here and there. It has served this purpose with excellence so far. Not the fastest tablet you'll ever find I'm sure, but no slowpoke either. And I would venture to say you will be hard-pressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at $50. Highly recommended.",2,2
My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.,2,2
I bought these as gifts. They were simple to operate and you can't beat it for the price.,2,2
I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.,0,0
My other kids have a tablet like this one and my youngest wanted one. They all love having their own and really like these. They were not a bad price either.,2,2
This product is excellent with apps available for many strraming services and capable of third party app implementations as well.,2,2
My God Daughter loves it it's just next time I should also get a screen protector for it because a few weeks later it has a small crack in it,1,2
Love the speed and apps offered through the unit. Had eliminated most of the buffering issues I've had with other streaming sticks.,2,2
"Love the look,feel and the light that this device has.",2,2
Wife enjoys the smaller version and the non glare screen,2,2
"Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.",1,0
"This unit is AWESOME! I totally did not expect it to be as good as most of the reviews but they were correct. What surprised me the most is the music sounded MUCH better than I would ever have expected. Even a technically challenged 59 year old grandma (me) was able to set it up with no help from sons, lol. SCORE! :)",2,2
Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.,2,2
Works great! This tablet has a great picture and moves much quicker than I expected.,2,2
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",2,1
"This is my second purchase of a Kindle Fire, an upgrade from the original, which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user. It is an excellent device with significant improvements over the original. My only issue is that a particular app that I routinely used apparently was only available on the original and is not available on the latest model.",2,2
Does what it said on the fire tv. Not a bad Device.,2,2
It is everything it promised. I use it to download books.,2,2
I wish that they could be use simultaneously to create surround sound in the home.,2,2
Okay don't like the setup. I like Android way better. Cannot download you tube. It is for my six year old who has lost 3 3ds xls if he can keep this one from damage's for 6 months he gets an up grade.its very small,0,2
"Superb sound quality with deep bass and loudness, excellent voice recognition with noise cancelling. Lot of Alexa apps with integration with Logitech remote, Philips Hue home automation devices.",2,2
This is my first tablet. It's very user friendly. Like the parental controls on it. So my kids can use it.,2,2
"I love my tablet so far! It does everything I need it to. Movies, music, games, and books. I love it for streaming movies. The video quality is fantastic. Reading is also super easy and I don't get headaches from the screen. Definitely happy. Bought my hubby one too.",2,2
Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.,2,2
I love my Alexa she is great. I can ask her guestions anytime and she will answer. I would buy this again,2,2
My godson loves it. He's only 4 and thinks this is the best thing ever.,2,2
"Love that I can access my amazon prime, along with the other services I subscribe to.",2,2
"Really pleased with voice recognition and the different apps that work with it. Google Home does a bit of a better job when it comes to search queries, however.",2,2
Alexa is such a great addition to our home. I would recommend to anybody.,2,2
"I like the ease of speaking to Alexis, she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and TV or radio. She can instantly fill most request for music and info and I love the stages when you set an alarm. I am a bit concern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or commands",2,2
"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop.",2,2
My kids love them I brought four so far for my kids good quality at the right price....they still haven't put them down,2,2
"Got this to replace a Roku. Similar content but more features and a seems bit faster. Only knock is minor: could be a bit more customizable. But overall an excellent, sleek interface.",2,2
This is the most incredible device. I absolutely in love. The kids can play games on it and I can check the weather. She can do anything!,2,2
I especially like the ability to name an artist and have random songs played. My 3 year old grandson loves talking to Alexa also....asking her to play nursery rhymes that he has recently learned in pre-school.,2,2
"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone.",0,0
It works good for kids and wherever you need for and good size,2,2
"Great Gift, can't wait to see my family's faces when they open this on Christmas!!!",2,2
"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.",2,2
The Amazon fire tv has a better resolution 4K and it already has most Apps installed on it and you can install your own too. I haven't regretted purchasing this amazing amazon amateur!!!!,2,2
Tablet is good for all around use. My kids use most and like to buy music and books through Amazon.,2,2
The tablet is easy to access and it was affordable.,2,2
This is my second kindle. I bought the original kindle when it came out and loved it! I upgraded to this newer version only because I dropped my old one and damaged the charger port. I'm extremely happy with the new version and use it daily.,2,2
"This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight.",2,2
My entire family has fun playing music and asking Alexa questions. A great purchase for our home.,2,2
I am shocked at the super low price for a very functional and handy tablet. Easily the best tablet on the market under $50!,2,2
Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.,0,0
Performs as expected. Appreciate the posting of new skills.,2,2
It's a good little tablet. I don't know if I would get this as my personal main tablet but the whole idea was for my son. He's loving it!,2,2
We love asking alexa stupid questions and its nice to just say what you want to listen to and it does it,2,2
"I have had several Kindle ereaders over the years also Nook, Kobo, and Sony as well, I even had the original Rocket Reader (I still have it) and they have all improved over the years so it's not surprising that the new Voyage is the best one yet. Over all I prefer the Kindle readers now and Amazon has perfected the eBook experience so why go anywhere else.",2,2
HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. GREAT TABLET . !!,2,2
Very ha day Very handy to have this plug I will use it what was that Very handy to have this plug will keep it as a as a extra extra one so that I can so that if I lose I lose the other plug I will have this one,2,2

This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.,2,2
"I love the convenience of using Alexa for anything from a timer to answering questions. Being able to get music on voice command is great as well, as I can pause and resume without grabbing my phone or a remote all the time. I would highly an Echo to anyone interested.",2,2
very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.,2,2
This is a great step up from the ATV which I had 3,2,2
one of the best products I have purchased. great sound,2,2

My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.,2,2
Great gifts!! Very much enjoyed by my family members.,2,2
Like all the features and voice recognition is very good. Although the product was setup for Berlin weather which makes me think this was a returned device and resold.,2,2
Its a great alternate for expensive canle tv services!,2,2
"It is an excellent gadget for getting information on lots of things like weather, playing music, traffic etc. I highly recommend this for household uses.",2,2
Have a nook as my first e-reader. I like downloading library books better on the kindle but prefer the format of the nook.,1,2
We purchased 3 of these tablets for all of our children. They are perfect for them with little worry that they will get destroyed. Still functional for everything they do on them.,2,2
"Recommend anyone wanting to watch a wide variety of things from movies, TV shows or sports to get one.",2,2
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!,2,2
Love the kindle. Easy to use and lots of free books to read,2,2
"I bought this for my son, and I'm going to buy myself one because I keep using his.",2,2
Gave this as a gift for my daughter so she can read and now she loves it.,2,2
"Didn't know how much I would like this but after trying to read on my tablet outside I decided to give this a shot. Love it, I can read in the sunlight or at night no problem, and the battery life is great",2,2
I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.,2,2
"It is a great tablet, I bought it for my 11 year old and he uses it responsibly. I also bought the glass screen protector and the sky blue cover for it in case he drops it. My son loves it and enjoys being able to not only play games on it, or take pictures, or even movies, but most importantly for the use of the advantages of it for its help when it comes to his education. I strongly recommend this product to everyone.",2,2
We have a lot of fun with the music asking questions Great tool,2,2
Bought 2 of these for my grand children. 4 and 2. They love them.,2,2
I really enjoy my echo. I also bought a battery for it so I can take it places,2,2

This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.,2,2
The Jetsons are finally here. This is technology that we only imagined watching episodes of the Jetsons,2,2
4k quality is great! The Alexa ffeature works awesome!!,2,2
I bought it for 34 $ during thanks giving. This is average product. I would suggest to go for Fire HD.,1,2
"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",2,2
"I don't use it nearly as much as I could. The kids love it. When they ask me questions I now tell them ""ask Alexa!""",2,2
"lightweight, convinient, feels like book. Great at outdoor and night reader.",2,2
This was simple to install and allows me to stream all of my favorite programs.,2,2
This is very easy to use. Opened up so many show possibilities.,2,2
"I had a 1st gen Fire and enjoyed it but this one is a lot more fun. Love the dual cameras, the more user friendly interface and the ability to add apps from google play, so my apps are in sync with the apps on my phone. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a versatile tablet.",2,2
I buy several of these tablets each year as giveaway for clients at conferences and they are always a hit!,2,2
Love the larger speaker. Works great. use as a music source mostly.,2,2
"Wife purchased she said does what she needs, loves it.",2,2
"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!",2,2
Cancelled my cable and i saved a lot of money from this..,2,2
Got this for my wife. Uses it everyday and performs great regardless of where your reading just like it's suppose to,2,2
"It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate",2,2
"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time.",2,2
This is an amazing item for the money. Cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.,2,2
I love that I can ask questions withouto having to go to a computer or cell.,2,2
"Great price, bought it to work with home automation products but haven't purchased those yet, that's next. Couldn't pass up the price and had points as well. We bought one with multiple accessories for our son last Christmas and he likes using the automation products. Generally similar to asking Siri things in an iPhone question wise. I like being able to add things to a shopping list and view then on my phone at the store. Still get several 'I don't know's' so only 4 stars so far. Probably a learning curve on our part too. Also good for cooking and converting measurements quickly. Like being able to control music and volume from my phone also. Glad we got it, looking forward to adding the home automation products.",2,2
Great little tablet for kids. Fast and easy to use.,2,2
"Makes reading books so easy, never loose your place when you stop.",2,2
"I purchased this device to use it in my work, and it's really did the job..",2,2
This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device,2,2
"I had a Kindle Fire HD 6"" but felt it was too small a screen and too heavy for how small it was. The Kindle Fire 7"" is perfect for me. I don't watch movies or videos so not having HD doesn't bother me. I am enjoying this one more.",2,2
"I absolutely love the Amazon Echo. It was by far one of my best purchases. It can sync with nearly everything, and on top of it you don't need to get off the couch or out of bed to use it. It recognizes your voice and answers right away, without delay. I would recommend this for anyone!",2,2
A great choice for children ages 3 to 13. Or even a great tablet for adults. It has many apps and games to choose from. The case it came with is very practical for beginners.,2,2
"The amazon reader is everything I dreamed it would be. I can read in the dark. It helps me get to sleep sooner, because the light is not as bright. My love of reading has only increased! ! A great purchase no doubt about that! !",2,2
The Amazon Fire was a great price and exceeded my expectations.The picture is so sharp.,2,2
Great tablet for everday use and the screen has nice resultion,2,2
"Not only can you read books, you can do everything on it such as play games, order from Amazon login to Facebook and so much more!",2,2
This was a great tablet for reading and searching the web!,2,2
Love this product has so many movies old to new as well as tv shows tv episodes. Its super.,2,2
Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.,2,2
Bought for my 8 year Old Granddaughter. She loved it,2,2
The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the inability to download directly from the Google play store. Otherwise good image and quick response.,2,2
I was impressed how clear the words on the screen are!,2,2
I wanted to find away to get rid of my extra cable boxes and that was it. It gives me even more than my smart devices.,2,2
"I love reading before going to bed, but backlit electronic devices tend to keep me awake just when I should be getting tired enough to fall asleep. The screen has a great resolution, the device is a snap to set up, and there's little to no glare if you take it outside. Additionally, the battery lasts just about forever. Straight out of the box I used it for almost three weeks before I charged I, and I still had nearly a quarter charge left. It's now my preferred reading device as compared to my tablets, which include an iPad and an LG Gpad. Highly recommended.",2,2
"I bought the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet while walking around and saw the price 34.99 at the time. got home and set it up immediately and added the Play store app by Google ( a bit tricky ) the device is nice to hold , battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at. my kids started using it and after that , I couldn't even get a turn to play with it. it's a great device for the $$ , even at regular price of 50 dollars, it still is a good purchase. my only ""concern"" about it is that I wish it had another 1 gig of ram , totalling 2 instead of just 1 gb ram. enjoy :)",2,2
"I have been a kindle owner for years, the original kindle had be great but I hated the absence of a backlight. and the kindle fire was similar to reading on my phone with hurting my eyes. so when the paperwhite was released I was intrigued. I finally received this as a Christmas gift and it's perfect. the battery can lasts weeks on a charge. There's no glare. my eyes never hurt. this is perfect for anyone who just wants to read ebooks. there is no headphone or speaker so audio books will not be able to be used. when typing the letters are a bit leggy but you get used to it. I did have a problem registering my amazon account but was able to contact amazon via chat and they fixed it within 5 min. definitely worth the money, I can now have books with me at all times.",2,2
The ads aren't as annoying as you think they would be. Pretty lightweight and good battery life. Good for casual use.,2,2
My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.,2,2
I wanted to find a tablet to give to my grandkids. Being able to spend 37.50 on Thanksgiving made this a no brainier for a tablet to give them. I was able to purchase 3 and they are really enjoying it. It may not be top of the line but it works great for them.,2,2
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.,2,2
NEW LARGER SCREENIS GREAT FOR WATCHING PRIME MOVIES AND READING BOOKS,2,2
"Debated between firetv and Apple TV and ultimately went with firetv due to price. Works great, easy set up and easy navigation. I have not had any buffering issues.",2,2
I have all bought all three of my girls Kindles and they have all been happy.,2,2
Great product. Except you have to have it plugged in all the time. No battery! So using it wherever you want becomes a little more complicated.,2,2
"Love this! So easy to use and great for music or to get a quick question answered. Can't wait to get it set up all the way to control lights, etc.",2,2
I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!,2,2
"my niece love it, of course her older and wild siblings like taking it from her but overall she say she love it.",2,2
easy hook up no fuse no hassle just plane easy plays music nice and loud the speakers are nice no distortion i enjoy it very must im glade i purchase this item,2,2
"Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.",2,0
Purchased this black Kindle as a gift for my niece after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.,2,2
I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun,2,2
This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.,2,2
Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.,2,2
I control everything and am having a blast. So cool,2,2
"I purchase it for my wife, is very good, small and fast.",2,2
I got this kindle at a black Friday sale at a great price. My daughter loves it .She was able to set it up for more than one user so her and her boyfriend can both use it.,2,2
Love the echo. Great for listening to music and quick information,2,2
"BEST thing that ive ever owned. my review is a comment i left in response to someones unfair, inaccurate 1 star review:sorry to hear that YOUR echo is useless. Mine on the other hand is awesome. just today alone, i used it as an alarm clock to wake up, turn on the lights and music to wake the kids for school, check how much gas was in my tank without going to the car, re-order toilet paper and laundry detergent for a price cheaper than the grocery store, hear the news headlines while drinking the coffee ""alexa"" made me when she turned on the coffee pot, roll a 20 sided die for a dungeons and dragons game with my one kid who managed to avoid summer school, pipe music into my home all day, order pizza for dinner, and get help with the kids algebra homework. After dinner we played jeopardy on it after the show aired, and used it to dim the lights inside, and turn on the porch lights outside when it got dark and i couldnt get up without disturbing my sleeping baby on my chest, who incidentaly fell asleep to the echo playing soothing music....she can also tell you facts about EVERYTHING you probably dont know, including starwars which pleases the kids, tells jokes, plays rock-paper-scissors, AND can call you an Uber. Have you tried activating her ever increasing fuctions via the alexa app? Oh, by the way, her speakers sound better than the bose speakers in my car so...yeah",2,0
Can't beat this lil tablet on value.Purchsed on black Friday so we got a great deal.Good battery life and the user experience is good too.I've had no problems with it and I am happy with my purchase.,2,2
Amazon has made a device that's very easy to use for a first time tablet user like myself.,2,2
Couldn't wait to get my hands on the fire tv. Better than the Apple TV,2,2
"Works fine for a $50 basic tablet/reader. Other functions, not so great. Very entry level.",1,2
Got them as Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts during the Black Friday. Works perfectly as an e-reader or as a basic tablet for watching youtube or reading anything online. You get what you pay for so don't compare this with Apple or Samsung. Happy with the purchase.,2,2
"BOTH CAMERAS WORK WELL. Videos are Great on this product. Down side is the on and off button seems to stick, I decided to see ifit can be fixed because I Like the product.",2,2
"I purchased the Echo for my husband as an early Christmas present. He loved it! We used it all during the holiday season to play holiday music. We use it every morning to check the weather. We also bought a smart plug and use the Echo to turn on our table lamp as we walk in the door in the evenings. We compete against each other in Jeopardy every day - he usually wins! As a result of my experience with the Echo, I bought 4 more for Christmas gifts and my enthusiasm for the Echo resulted it one being under many of my friends' families Christmas trees!",2,2
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain.",2,2
Data is tied to skills and should just be a blanket open forum of knowledge. Still has other benefits to explore.,1,2
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing,2,2
Works great.Great buy.Wouldn't have anything else.,2,2
"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",2,2
"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent.",2,2
"It is an excellent tablet, however it's app store is not as good as android.",2,2
"After using the amazon fire tv for about two months, I can say that this is an excellent streaming device. I connected the fire TV to through the Yamaha receiver to my TV, therefore I get a perfect 5.1 sound. Amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscriptions or buy movies if you want to watch the new stuff on the market. But here is the good news, you can use the device even without an amazon subscription - with Netflix, PBS, and so many other downloadable applications. With an 128 GB USB flash drive formatted in FAT32, this device may become an ideal player connected to your TV",2,2
"Decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen.",1,2
"Simple tablet that does what it is supposed to do. Don't be too worried about the 8 gig memory, you can use a memory card to upgrade",2,2
"This is an android based devise, so you can do anything with it. Install Kodi and you are good to want anything you want",2,2
"Loads of apps available, Netflix , PlayStation vue, Hulu , etc. very useful to setup in a basement with no cable outlet.",2,2
"Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies",2,2
"Gave to my brother as a gift, and he takes it everywhere with hin",2,2
Easy to set up and easy to use. The description is exactly what you get. I love this product for all its content.,2,2
"Tho she wouldn't make herself real for me, this is a nice gadget.",2,2
"This piece of electronics is amazing. Alexa can answer questions for you, give you weather and news updates, and play your favorite music. Have had the unit several weeks and am very pleased with it.",2,2
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,2,2
I like the slick size and the whole voice remote. Now with Alexa you can even control your smart home devices. I upgraded from Fire Stick and the interface needs getting used to.... I like the stick lay out .,2,2
"Got this on black Friday sale & for the price, you couldn't beat it. I ended up purchasing 3 of these. The graphics & camera are definitely limited, but if all you need is a basic tablet to run Amazon apps, this is great for the price. The fact that it is expandable with an SD card puts it above the more expensive basic Kindle that my kids use that constantly is full.",2,2
works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well,2,2
I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.,2,2
It works great for Netflix and amazon streaming I love these boxes,2,2
"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to ""fade in"" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page.",2,2
Highly recommend this box best box I have ever had,2,2
"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook.",2,2
"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. Free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. School websites dont work. Wish I had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase.",2,2
"We bought this for our second grader. It is great for her practice math apps, her daily reading, and fun time too! Plus it grows with her. As she gets older and likes different games, apps, etc., old stuff is radily erased and new stuff added",2,2
I bought this for my daughters for Christmas but it has some limitations and doesn't let you do some stuff the other kindles did.,2,2
"I love it. Long battery life, easy to use, perfect",2,2
Love the new look and feel of my new Kindle Voyage. I especially love how it adjusts the reading light automatically.,2,2
Great sounding speaker and microphones seems to work well. Good options for playing music as well as easy to set up. Wish there were better connection with iPhone so it is easier to request and play songs from iTunes as well as to make calls from phone.,2,2
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,2,2
We purchased this tablet for our 3 year old daughter. She loves playing learning and interactive games. This is great!!!!!!,2,2
"The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8"" tablet is just the right size.",2,2
I love this product. My wife was not too happy at first because I placed in our bedroom. Now she loves it as she can listen to music when she is putting on her make up in the mornings.,2,2
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet,2,2
"I like Alexa, but limited. Can't connect with I-Tunes account yet. Can only set a one time alarm with 24 hours and cannot make it recurring. I see improvements weekly, but still a long way to go.",1,2
"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase.",2,0
I love my firestick. We choose not to do cable to save money in our first apartment and it has been great with the firestick.,2,2
"If you are a reader, this is the e-reader to own. I have ipads, Samsung tablets and two nooks, but this is the one I love. Get yours!!",2,2
The product is relatively inexpensive but the performance could be better.,1,2
"it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone",1,2
Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.,2,2
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.,2,2
Researched this ahead of time and pleased so far. Good processing speed and no issues streaming. Got this specifically to get PlayStation Vue.,2,2

"Brought it for my toddler for xmas, so hopefully it works great.",2,2
Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.,2,2
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.,2,2
Really have enjoyed this item.,2,2
I bought this as a gift for my husband. He uses it every day. It is easy to read on.,2,2
I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,2,2
"No idea as I haven't opened it up yet. I bought it for my non smart TV and as a potential replacement for Xfinity cable box. From the reviews, it should work fine for what I intend to do with it.",2,0
Just wish I could remember everything we can ask Alexa.,2,2
"A must have for music lovers. Alexa has enabled me to play Amazon prime music as well as Pandora, etc. I love the hands free operation. I am learning how to use Alexa to find out information and other new things. LOVE it.......",2,2
Not too big not too small. He can take he tablet for long rides so he's not bored and also learn with it.,2,2
Awesome tablet for the price. Great experience in store there to help when I needed it and not hovering over me while I browsed,2,2
"I decided to get the Fire TV after one of my remote Media Centers failed. With my movie collection on my server, I was able to install Kodi on the Fire TV and continue to stream my movies over the network. Add in our subscription to Netflix, HBO GO, Stars Play, and Amazon Prime membership, the Fire TV offers a wide range of entertainment.",2,2
"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!",2,2
"Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader.",2,2
"Is very easy to operate, bought as an extra for when Grandchildren visit because I love to use mine to read and couldn't if they wanted to play with my reader !",2,2
"Amazon always has great products, I would purchase again",2,2
"I got this for a Christmas present for my son, but couldn't help myself. It's awesome. Looks like momma is rewrapping for him, or buying another :D",2,2
"Purchased to replace old Kindle. Was surprised at cost difference, though.",2,2
Great tablet if you have an amazon prime account. Not able to download some apps that are current. works better if you stay with in amazon.,2,2
Great product plays my music controls my lights tons of info also makes an awesome alarm clock and it keeps getting smarter.,2,2
"I read a lot, this tablet makes it convenient for me to carry many books without all the weight. The screen lighting is adjustable for different light situations.",2,2
Bought the tablet for a larger screen than my phone. Love it.,2,2
"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that. But you defintely get what you pay for",2,1
Bought kindle for a gift as the one my daughter had 5 years ago starting not to work right. She loves this rader and got good reviews about it.,2,2
I loved the amazon echo. Been wanting one since it came out and broke down and got it. Great choice,2,2
I bought this for a Christmas gift. They love it! Very happy with purchase.,2,2
"Replacement charger for my son's Kindle, works great, highly recommended.",2,2
"This is definitely not an iPad or a high end tablet. Nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it (so, less than $50), it is well worth getting. I wanted something bigger while waiting for the next iPad Air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. It is geared towards Amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than HD. If the sale comes back again where it is $15 off, I would not hesitate to recommend it again.",1,0
This is a great product to purchase I love that you can watch whatever out there too watch with out leaving the comfort of your own home,2,2
"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",1,2
"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one.",0,2
best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!,2,2
Bought this for a friend in the hospital.very easy for him to use as he uses it endless hrs.the picture quality is good also ..would buy product again,1,2
I love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world!,2,2
I bought this as a raffle prize and it was a big hit of the young as well as the old.,2,2
I love the convenience of the Amazon Echo! Alexa is amazing! Very easy to use!,2,2
"I had the 1st Kindle, but this one is much better!",2,2
Kindle e reader is a wonderful device. I like the inbuilt light. It does not hurt eyes and it does not have side effects (headache or hang over in the morning) if used in the night unlike tabs.,2,2
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1",2,2
Great tablet that can be used for kiddos and those not great with technology.,2,2
"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great.",2,2
The best ebook reader in the market. The text is crisp and I love the backlighting.,2,2
"ECHO is great, still learning but Alexa is full of apps skills. Love how responsive it is.",2,2
"This box has it all! Does 4K and also has a super fast Quad Core Processor. Has great WIFI AC, and also has the Ethernet plug in. Great Streaming machine, but the best thing about it is the PRICE!",2,2
Works well.great for playing games and daily information,2,2
"It takes a lot of time and subscribing to get the channels I want, so I will write another review next year when I got them all..hopefully !!",0,2
Excellent device to have if you travel a lot. Hooks right up to the hotel TV and gives you access to all of the great content you have at home. Works great!,2,2
Alexa is the most useful product I have purchased. My Husband is handicapped and home all day while I work. He asks Alexa to put the lights on for him and she does. He ask her to tell him a joke and she does. Anything he wants to know he turns to Alexa...,2,2
"I Love The Sound, The Sleekness, And Help With Questions, The Music She Plays While Im In The Kitchen Cooking.No More CD,S, Or Tapes. I Have Her Sister The Dot In Another Room, I Use Her For An Alarm Clock.I Think Every One Should Have One.;).",2,2
For the price. You can't go wrong. If you're looking for something basic and don't want to spend a lot of money. Here's your tablet. Good for kids that will pretty much will ruin you're expensive ipad or something.,2,0
Excellent love it works great love design..wonderful,2,2
"My wife bought it for her office but they wouldn't allow her to use the wifi so she brought it home. Use it mostly for music and asking silly questions, but we enjoy it. Broadens our musical library.",2,2
Bought as a gift for my husband. Works as expected.,2,2
"My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",2,0
I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I can read at night without my eyes bothering me. The builtIn light is an awesome feature. The screen looks just like the pages of a book.,2,2
"Great gift for a kid to read, surf and play music!",2,2
Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend,2,2
"The echo is a great product to play hard to find music and keep you updated on weather, current events, and trivia information.",2,2
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write",2,1
Great for kids. Has many applications that can help kids learn more and easier,2,2
Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.,2,2
"I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously.",2,2
I purchased this tablet based on price and the reviews for tablets in this price range. It has performed well for my child. I especially love the parental controls that are easy to setup and the ability to have multiple profiles on 1 device. I'm now thinking of buying one for myself to replace a stolen iPad.,2,2
Does just what it says. Easy to set up and use. Great alternative to cable.,2,2
I bought this product for my 4 year old grandaughter and she loves using it,2,2
I really like the echo for controlling my hue lights. Sometimes it will do stuff with out even saying alexa though other than that decent product,2,2
"Good tablet for the price. It is fast, battery life is ok.",2,2
"I love this streamer. The fact that all the apps I use are on this machine and the service from Amazon is amazing, it's very worth the money. Alexa is easy to use also. A recommended buy.",2,2
Works great wife uses it everyday she downloads books from amazon,2,2
"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality",1,2
"So easy to use anywhere there is an outlet. I had a charger that would work,so I debated about buying this. I'm so glad I did.",2,2
Second Alexa in our house and we love it. Don't need a radio anymore. She plays a whole CD or will scan through all the song of one particular artists or group.,2,2
The Amazon Echo is one device I could not imagine being without. It is always there for music and any random question I have.,2,2
i no longer us tv this is my new go to for my tv show needs,2,2
Love reading on my Kindle. So many book selections.,2,2
Bought this for my 12yr old son. Can't get him off of it. Gave it 3 stars because it doesn't support google play store and doesn't load most pics on pinterest sometimes. You might need a memory card if you purchase 8gb tablet.,1,0
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,0,0
I love it. Work good well .like to get a few more of my home,2,2

It is inexpensive so you can get many of them. It also has a speaker.,2,2
Bought it to replace my nephew's tablet that I broke. He loves it.,2,2
Great tablet my 2 kids have 3.They have an extra one for the roadI would definetly recommend it.,2,2
First time I have ever used a Kindle Fire and I wasn't disappointed. It is very good tablet. The only downside is that there aren't that many apps like the Google store has.,2,2
My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.,2,2
"And this is amazing. Blows Apple TV out of the water with all the customizations..especially Kody. I have every apple product that currently exists, including all their computers, however, I will be replacing all my 4th gen Apple TVs with the Fire Tv.",2,2
"Old Kindle was not working consistently very well, so purchased an new Kindle Paperwhite that is backlit and it is a great improvement over my old Kindle...loveit!",2,2

I am very happy with my Amazon Fire TV. I set my 19 year old daughter to install it and she had it up and running in a matter of a couple minutes.,2,2
My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play… Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.,2,2
I've had several kindles over the years and this is by far the best one yet! I love the paper white and will never go back to anything else. I use it everywhere! You will not regret this purchase!,2,2
My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.,1,2
Very handy and easy to use! I recommend this product!,2,2
Would recommend for anyone great value big screen great features,2,2
This is the most amazing thing!What can't it do? Say a command and instantly you'll get it. Incredible!!,2,2
I purchased this tablet for my grandchildren over the holidays. they are 3 and 6yrs old. they love it . it's easy to use - and they are able to scroll through the programs easily.,2,2
Not very much 4k content but it still get the job done,2,2
"The Echo is great, I use it every day! Great for music while doing the dishes, all I have to do is give a voice command and don't even have to dry off my hands. Every morning I wake up and can't open my eyes because I'm so tired, so instead of looking for the weather I just ask Alexa and plan my day accordingly.",2,2
"It's a great product, I would buy another for a family member. I do hope they lower the price a little in the future",2,2
I really enjoy this new kindle much brighter and easier to read,2,2
"Very large, pretty quick processing, great picture",2,2
you will never be lonely again she talks to you and answers questions she can read your kindle books too and tell you the weather she will tell you jokes she is well worth the money also play music from your library and ihart radio and much more things,2,2
"It has a great picture. But, This is not different from the original fire stick.",2,2
This adapter helps free up computer ports so that charging my kindle is not in my way.,2,2
I absolutely love reading on the Kindle Paperwhite. It's great being able to sit outside and read and not worry about the glare. It's very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand.,2,2
Absolutely love my Kindle fire. Would buy for friends and family. It is the perfect combination of a tablet and e-reader.,2,2
Good streamer especially helpful for children. Having a Netflix account helps.,2,2
"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to.",0,1
"The amazing Amazon echo. That is the perfect heading for the speaker. Actually it's far more than the speaker, this may be one of the best purchases I've ever made. I use it to order an Uber, to order pizza, to look up recipes and to buy things on Amazon simply a genius product.",2,2
Loved the item - worked great. Packaging was good. I was very pleased,2,2
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it Many apps for kids,2,2
This Kindle is better than any I have had before. Love the multi-brightness dimming ability. I have zero complaints with this item.,2,2
"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet.",2,2
"This is my first E-Reader but I have numerous mobile devices and I can say without hesitation that this reader is awesome. It's just like reading a book. I have no complaints, fits my needs perfectly. Very pleased with my purchase.",2,2
I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.,2,2
"We heard the hype and did not think we would like it or use it...purchased it on sale for $89. This gadget is way cool and is fun to use. Very useful for playing Amazon Prime Music. We like it for getting the news and weather instantaneously. We integrated it with Nest and WeMo and it works pretty well. We had hoped it would work with our Sonos system but allegedly that integration is coming by the end of 2017. The speaker isn't bad and overall, we are happy with Echo and it's a nice to have for what we paid for it.",2,2
"Great for reading books. Print is easily readable. There are a couple of font sizes to adjust to your eyesight, as well as different font types to choose from. It's very easy to change them on the fly without going deep into settings.It has nice features, such as dictionary, where you can quickly check unfamiliar words while reading, create notes, or write and read reviews.Getting books to the reader is straightforward as well. If you have wi fi connection, all you need is to create account. The selected books will be automatically transferred to your reader.If you don't have wi fi, connecting the reader with USB cable should be enough, but make sure if that works before you buy it.Battery charge lasts for a few weeks. You don't have to worry to charge it every day.The charger is not included though. Either you can charge the reader through your computer or buy the charger.Charger is faster and more convenient.There are a lot of websites offering Kindle books, there's a big selection of free books to choose from too. Public libraries, Amazon, number of various websites provide wealth of readings for Kindle.Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.On negative note, I wish the screen was a little bigger, as I don't carry it around, and it's not cheap either.",2,2
This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.,2,2
"This is my 3rd Kindle, and we are very pleased with the ease of use and features Amazon has to offer. I suggested my brother get one for his kids and he too is happy. He actually uses it as much or more than his kids do. If you are looking to buy one, I suggest buying a case to help protect it from any bumps or bruises. I lost my 1st Gen Kindle because it was dropped without a case.",2,2
"An excellent product, easy on the eyes when reading. Lots of apps and access to a wide variety of books, catalogs, magazines and news outlets. I would highly recommend it.",2,2
"I use it every single day. In the kitchen for cooking timers, to listen to music, and to control lights in our house. It has definitely made our busy lives convenient. Highly recommend it if you are thinking of automating your house.",2,2
I was searching for a tablet that would be great for reading books and downloading games. This kindle is the right size for a tablet. Works great!,2,2
Such an amazing product. Sounds great and works perfect.,2,2
This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.,2,2
was skeptical at first because I thought it would be the same as the fire stick.Boy was I wrong.4k is awesome on my 4k tetevision.,2,2
"The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.",2,2
If you like to read and travel this is the answer to that problem. You can read just about any paper in the country at any time.,2,2
"Real easy to use. Great price. Got 2 of them. One for me and one for my friends son. He uses it to download free books to read, and games to play.",2,2
If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.,2,2
I got this on thanksgiving! It was super cheap and I'm glad they had it in stock!,2,2
I love these Amazon products! I have so many Amazon products at home I refer everyone gets one,2,2
Bought this for my nephew for christmas who has been asking for a tablet. It was on sale for an outrageous deal and couldn't pass up. Works fine and he love it. would recomend,2,2
I really enjoy this kindle. It's fun to use and cool.,2,2
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case,2,2
"I purchased he Fire because you can do more with it. I have an Apple TV (2nd gen) and I enjoyed it, but was looking for something a little faster. So far it's been great. Being able to side load other apps has been great and the Amazon Prime content is pretty good.",2,2
Set it up for my husband and he loves it. Was a great value for product.,2,2
Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.,2,2
"I bought this for my aunt. She reads all the time. As she got older she hated carrying multiple books with her everyday and when she traveled. This Kindle solved all those problems. She especially likes being able to read magazines, periodicals, and check out library books electronically. She loves this thing!!",2,2
I love my Alexa product. Even considering getting the smaller speaker for my bedroom so I can listen to music to fall asleep,2,2
I bought this one for my mom because I love mine so much,2,2
"After reading several reviews, I purchased this as my first Kindle because it wasn't the lowest-level Kindle but I didn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive one. I purchased this specifically because of it's size and ability to read outside with no glare issues. The ads are not annoying enough to make me wish I paid more for the ad-free versions. It is a perfect price-point for reading outside and on the go.",2,1
This was purchased for a 2nd TV. No issues- love it,2,2
"I'm currently living in Korea and needed American television to keep me entertained. I had Kodi installed on a FireStick, however, despite having a 100Mbps service plan, my wireless connection couldn't keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming. My solution was to purchase the FireTV and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet. The difference was immediately noticeable, I haven't had any buffering issues and programs load up immediately. I would definitely recommend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with WIFI signals and plan on using bandwidth heavy applications such as Kodi. The ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your ISP.",2,1
Have another ereader but wasn't able to read it outside. This is much easier to read outside. It has lived up to expectations.,2,2
i got tihs so i can watch hulu and netflix and it is pretty fast,2,2
"Love it, talk to it all the time. Even tell it good night every night !!! She is pretty smart !!!",2,2
Came in great packaging. Everything is there. Works great!,2,2
"I bought the Amazon Fire for my granddaughter for her 8th birthday. She just loves it so much. She said it was the right size and everything. Truly excited her, Grandma gets an A+! I would like to add that the $49 price tag for this high quality tablet can't be beat.",2,2
The plug seems to be working well. I think it's the connection in my Kindle that is worn out!,2,2
"Bought them as gifts for my nephews, who are teenagers, and they love them. Obviously you cannot expect them to be as high quality as the $400-500 tablets, but for $35 on black Friday they will serve their purpose.",2,2
My niece loves her kindle tablet. She uses it all the time.,2,2
This is by far my favorite tablet on the market. Has all that high priced tablets ioffer,2,2
"This nice, color e-reader doubles as an excellent low-cost tablet.",2,2
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.,2,2
"This Amazon Echo Literally is a plug and play product. Even an old man, old school non-techie like myself was playing stump the band in no time.",2,2
I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,1,2
Works fine as advertised. Will recommend it to anyone.,2,2
Bought this tablet just to use in 1 room. It works great!,2,2
The Amazon Fire TV box is a wonderful device. I love the Alexa voice search feature. Wish there were more movie options for Amazon Prime members.,2,2
This was a great present for my husband who is extremely tech savvy and very particular about his choice of equipment. He was overjoyed with this. Glad I choose to stick with Samsung.,2,2
This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear.,2,2
"I love having this in my home. It does so much I have barely scratched the surface with it. I have Amazon Prime so I can call out whatever music I am in the mood for and it will more times than not play. I haven't yet used it for lights, Uber, or any of the other many things it can do. A lot of fun.",2,2
We love this device it controls the lights in home,2,2
My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.,2,2
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.,2,2
I can get to anything I'm needing to from the home screen. Helps simplity everything!,2,2
Bought the two tablets for two of my younger grandkids. So far the tablets have held up well. My daughter likes having the ability to limit what the kids can use the tablets for.,2,2
It's pretty fast response time on switching between apps and pretty good 4k visual also.,2,2
"I bought one for my 7 year old and one for my 3 year old. I love that I completely control the content and time use. It's easy to use, and small enough for kids to hold.",2,2
"Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!",2,2
"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it.",2,2
"Love this Amazon Fire TV. I hooked it up to my bedroom TV and started watching all of my favorite shows on Netflix, and other apps that comes on this! Great!",2,2
The sound is not good but it was easy to set up. Alexa itself his limited capabilities.,2,2
great tablet and great price that I purchase 3 for all my children. They have no complaints. And if it breaks I can easily afford buying a new one.,2,2
Easy to use grandson enjoys it .plus the two year warranty you can't beat kids can be rough on tablets.,2,2
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Uses it every day,2,2
"I purchased this tablet for my 2 year old niece, and it works great, no issues at all, she mainly uses it to watch barney and Elmo episodes... easy to setup parental controls for safety... easy to handle especially for a child, very small and lightweight... recommend to all",2,2
The Echo is awesome! I purchased this with the intention of controlling my Hue Lights through voice however it has much more features than expected. My wife now turns it on daily for iHeart Radio. I purchased this almost 1 month ago and I'm still discovering new things with it. The only issue is there is no Plex app however I'm sure one is in the works soon.,2,2
"this is a great item, I used it to replace my tv. A+",2,2
This tablet is perfect for my lil brother. He love it,2,2
I have owned a few kindle's in the past and this one works as good if not better than the others. I'm an avid reader and I get a lot of use out of my kindle and it's small enough to fit just about anywhere. I love that it comes in different colors too!,2,2
"Bought as replacement for Kindle HD 7 2012 model. Works great, considering the price. The expandable storage is awesome!",2,2
This is a nice tablet for the price. Functional for your basic needs.,2,2
"I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in. Then after contacting Amazon Tech help & researching found out that Amazon & Netflix parted ways and do not support each other. So, I returned the device and purchased the Roku4 instead to great satisfaction.",0,0
I am able to read in any sort of light and able to change the font size.,2,2
I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.,2,2
Very simple setup and a great little item for the price.,2,2
"I wasn't looking for anything complicated just something to read books on, play a few games, watch videos. At those things it does very well.",2,2
This was purchased for my daughter. She absolutely loves this tablet. It's a perfect size for her. She has not stopped using it since we gave it to her. It's an excellent product to keep her busy and entertained. The graphics are awesome. The price we paid was well worth it. We will keep shopping at Best Buy,2,2
Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,1,2
"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.",2,2
Our child has had one for a few years now and his cousin wanted one so we bought one as a gift. Cannot get the two of them to put them down.,2,2
My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.,2,2
I bought 2 of these for my niece & nephew! They think I'm awesome now!!! I'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.,2,2
"Small yet powerful; HDMI connection, 4K capable. Amazon content plus Android framework. Nearly perfect!",2,2
Works great with my older Kindle!,2,2
One of the best streaming services out there amazon fire tv is a great product.,2,2
So cool & easy to use. It was easy to connect & sounds really good.,2,2
This device works like butter. Better than Roku. Tx,2,2
We bought Alexa for Father's Day.. my husband is so attach to this Robot and we are too!!,2,2
"The Paperwhite is an excellent product. It is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and user-friendly (software wise). Be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet (or Amazon Fire); this is because of the e-ink. However, I will take the trade off, as you are able to read e-ink in every environment (sunlight, dark rooms) without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet. Screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.If you have a Prime membership, you have access to all of Amazon's library, which has a large selection; however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to Amazon's Kindle App, which is an additional $10/month. I find this to be mildly frustrating. However, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.Overall, I think the Paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. I enjoy reading on it very much.",2,2
great for the kids and protection is good ! and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product...,2,2
Great item.... good addition to home and family. Recommended for everyone!,2,2
"I recommend this to everyone, the ability to get information that is quicker than a push of a button. Awesome",2,2
This was a gift to a friend and she loved it! It's great for a starter tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet at a great price!,2,2
"Don't hesitate to purchase. Works great. My son has the Fire Stick which works great, but this Fire TV is so much faster and more responsive. Love it.",2,2
Does well when you speak loud and clear. Easy to setup just use your phone and add the WiFi password,2,2
"I'm a computer geek so I excited when my Wife go me a tablet for Christmas. I enjoy playing games, reading books/magazines, and like the small compact size with power.",2,2
Amazon free time great for small kids to get entertained,2,2
"My 2 year old grand daughter loves it. Amazon has a lot of age appropriate apps to download. I know longer have to have my precious girl snatch at my phone saying ""My toy Papa!""",2,2
My 4 yo grandnephew and 3 yo daughter love them! The tablet does freeze but that's what happens sometimes! They love them!,1,2
"When you buy an Amazon product from Best buy they will not take responsibility after two weeks and said to speak to Amazon directly,But you cannot return any Amazon products bought from Best buy to Amazon, Do not buy Amazon products from Best buy but ever again as you are doomed with it",0,0
"I love my new Kindle! I have owned them all and each one improves on the last. It's a great way to read! I have the origami book cover as well and did not expect to like it but actually, I love it!",2,2
Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!,2,2
It is amazing! Most wonder product ever bought! Would recommend it,2,2
I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.,2,2
One of our best home purchases. The echo has been very helpful to us daily.,2,2
Easy to set up. The parental controls and safety features make this a great purchase.,2,2
The tablet is not bad at all for the price I paid during Black Friday. The only issue for me is the occasional pausing during streaming on netflix,2,0
It's a great table for kids and first time user of tables.,2,2
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.,2,2
I purchased it to read books and I love the fact that I can play games on it also. Works fine and is easy to use and for the price I do not think you can go wrong.,2,2
Love my Amazon echo! Everything exactly as advertised,2,2
I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing,2,2
Reading in bright sunlight is now easy on the eyes,2,2
My daughter can't get enough of this tablet. The only thing I would suggest that you have YouTube kids as a pre installed app. The adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the App Store.,2,0
I bought three of these units. On sale for $34 apiece. Great deal. Great price,2,2
"Runs better that a fire stick and it buffers faster two, great for streaming Netflix, and Hulu in HD, I haven't had any issues with these programs and if you have amazon prime you can link your account for streaming, purchasing and renting titles.",2,2
Bought three of these during the Black Friday sale for family gifts. Everyone loved them. Cheap and fun little tablet to have.,2,2
"If you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall, and then plug the big end of the USB cable into the non-prongy side, and then plug the little end of the USB cable into your Kindle, it makes books magically appear on the screen. Use your eyes to read the words, and your eyes will transmit the information into your brain.",2,2
"I had originally decided to get a kindle instead of an iPad due to the cost. It's a great screen and has good sound, but the battery is pure junk! I should have went with an iPad.",0,2
This device is wonderful and very handy. I really like this very much.,2,2
"So far, I've enjoyed all that the Fire TV has to offer and its functionality. It's very responsive and loads shows/movies/music instantly. The only thing that is annoying, is that the remote will intermittently not work. If I tap the remote, take out then reinsert the battery, it will work again. I've tried replacing ""new batteries with ""new batteries"" with the same result. Not sure if it's a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit. It's not very frequent, so I tend to over look it. The unit and the remote will occasionally go through software updates, so I'll see if that takes care of it first.",2,2
"The echo works great around the house. From setting timers, to listening to music, to reordering paper towels.",2,2
Bought the Kindle for my grandkids they just love they play with it all the time they use it to read books play games they just love it,2,2
"Purchased after reviewing online, and it has lived up to all expectations.",2,2
Echo dot on steroids! Love it. Own the dot AND the regular echo.,2,2
"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.",2,2
STill learning all that goes with Alexa. I also appreciate the email updates on the product,2,2
Bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Fairly easy for him to use and me to monitor. Definitely recommend the case.,2,2
The tablet works great! No problems or concerns! Great for kids also.,2,2
"This echo does just about anything, just ask her and she has the answer. She works together with my harmony remote perfectly. Cant wait to link her to my hue lights !!",2,2
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad.",2,2
I recently cut the cord with cable and couldn't be happier. This fire TV box has made it so easy with so many ways to watch programming. I love it!,2,2
I am so pleased with each and every product I purchased!!!!! Everything is GREAT!,2,2
Blazing fast and ready to go if you are an Amazon fanatic. All I had to do was link it to my wifi and my account - and DONE!,2,2
"Hated it ! You have to purchase everything from Amazon ! Took it back within a couple days! Got the roku ,,,,, way better !",0,2
I use this device in my office to stream music and keep up on the news. Overall a good experience so far.,2,2
"Great tablet for kids since it's price friendly, and it has an option for child users.",2,2
I would highly recommend this product!! I wish that I had purchased this item a long time ago!,2,2
"We have 2 Roku 3s, and we like the Fire TV better. It works so much better with our SlingBox...you don't have to go through your cellphone. Our Rokus freeze up frequently, but the Fire TV has only done this once. (So far!) We will probably buy a second one for our bedroom and move the Roku 3 to a guest bedroom.",2,2
Easy connection and very good playing different apps.,2,2
Alexa is the greatest product ever I use it around the house all of the time,2,2
"I had to pick this up, for the deal of the day, when I saw it.",2,2
I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.,2,2
Very stable system. Pretty much identical to fire stick. Only pay more money to stream limited 4k content.,2,2
"The Paperwhite is certainly better than the regular Kindle, primarily due to the back lighting feature. If you buy a Kindle eReader, this would be the one to buy. You could spend more for the higher end models but there's really no need. The main issue with this eReader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen. I tried two Paperwhites and both had the same issue. Perhaps this is just how they are.",1,1
"Love it....the color is bright which makes it easy to find in a suitcase or carry on bag. I carry lots of stuff in my pocketbook because the color is neon yellow it stands out. So easy to grab and read. Took it on vacation loved it. I recommend the color cover rather than black one,",2,2
"I am extremely happy with the box, well over the stick. Twice as fast, twice as much RAM and up to almost 30 times as much memory",2,2
Good tablet for a good price. Great for our 8 year old,2,2
I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.,2,2
My daughter loves it! This device provided all the services she wanted.,2,2
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old it's a good tablet for the 33 dollars I paid. I just wish I could remove some of the Amazon apps.,1,2
Works great. TV how you want it watch movies and tv shows anytime.,2,2
"the price was right and I wanted it for it's ease, because I will be using it in my door to door ministry. thank you,",2,2
I love my kindle paperweight! It is great upgrade from the kindle touch,2,2
Purchased this blue kindle as a gift for my nephew after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.,2,2
This was the perfect gift for my mom and she loves it so much. She reads like crazy and this does not hurt her eyes like other devices. Great product and recommended for anyone who reads at all!,2,2
The Amazon box works so much better than the fire stick less lag and buffer.,2,2
Thank you they were great gifts for my sisters loved it,2,2
Nice tablet. Great gift item. Gives me flexibility in being able to check email and play games anywhere in the house. My only wish is that the screen were a little larger.,2,2
"This is a very good tablet for the price (about $50 regular price). Good image quality and battery life. Have been a Prime member for several years, so the included media access - videos, audio and books - is great. It is NOT an android tablet, so much of the Google ecosystem is not available. The Amazon AppStore has lots of options, but not nearly as many as the Google Play Store.Would recommend adding a microSD storage card. Also would get better file manager and video playback apps. There are several good, free options from Amazon's AppStore.",2,2
I'm buying 2 more for gifts. I love them. I have 2 already,2,2
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.,2,2
"I bought a few of these Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) boxes and I don't notice it performs any better than the older model even its specs are showed that it has better hardware components. Just for the fun of it, I have rooted and am still learning what else can I do with it...",2,1
This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.,2,2
I like the Kindle but have had to restart it twice as it froze.Still a great way to travel and still have books available to read.,2,2
I have so many different apps that I use to watch my movies and TV and this device groups them all. The remote makes searching a breeze and Alexa is entertaining to talk to. I would get multiple of these. Amazon is adding a LOT of great features to prime. Oh and I hope you have PRIME when you get this. If you dont your wasting money. Get prime and get the fire TV,2,2
"well worth the money, it's just a pretty well thought out tablet, the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease.it's also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun, good looking games. which is pretty amazing at this price point.",2,2
My wife loves it plays games with her all the time and shows it of,2,2
Bought for my 14 year old and she loves it. Reads books on in all the time,2,2
I will buy another one. Very convenient and portable.,2,2
This is great! Wish I had more instructions on what she can do,2,2
I like Alexa device. I am using this since one month.This is future of communication.,2,2
"Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity.",2,2
Fabulous new functionality love the night reading capabilities,2,2
Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.,2,2
The parent said she loved the tablet but her son loves it more. He sleeps with it to keep his siblings from touching it. Best gift ever!!!!,2,2
I got this for my 7 year old daughter. Serves its purpose. It's easy to use and for the price you can't get anything better.,2,2
"Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework.",2,2
This item is great got for my sister as a birthday gift. She uses it for reading and music,2,2
Roku is great! I would recommend! You can watch a bunch of Movies.,2,2
"I 'm very please with the tablet haven't had any problem. It does everything I need it to do. I would recomend it.,",2,2
We pay over six $540 a month for Verizon I would never ever pay for cable again all you need is fast Internet I was never the one to sit and watch movies but now since I have the fire stick I love it,2,2
so much better than my 3 year Fire for versatility.,2,2
My son loves to play it...........::::........:....,2,2
"I take my paper white reader every where with me. It fit nicely in my purse. I read all the time, even in the car where the sun is shinning in on it. I just love my paper white and wish I had bought one sooner.",2,2
"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it.",2,2
This tablet works perfectly for my eight old. She loves it.,1,2
Very easy to use. Very fast & good price. Would recommend this for a beginner,2,2
Installed the Echo in to my house that we have Nest thermostats in and WeMo light switches its interfaces with those devices are flawlessly. I can ask Echo to turn on or off lights or set the temperature on my thermostats. It does too many things to list. The voice recognition is the best I have used on any product.,2,2
The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.,2,2
"Not a cheap plug from the check out, this works for my phone and kindle without the nasty reminder that the cord or plug are not strong enough.",2,2
worth the pennybought for my 2 year old daughter who loves playing the games on the amazon store (a decent collection of free games)+ watch you tube or stored videos.Only prob is that haven't found any cable so that it can stream the videos on TV (have to go for Fire TV stick),2,2
Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.,2,2
Had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. Enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.,2,2
"Alexa is awesome!!! She tells jokes, plays my favorite music by requests, sets timers for me.",2,2
"Easy Setup and easy to use. I get new, weather and traffic before I get out of bed to look for the remote.",2,2
So much fun and can do tons of things. Great to ask questions and get info. Can even control temperature in the home as well as lights with added products.,2,2
Alexa is great! I would recommend it to anyone! She answers any question. I ask. I love her for the speaker aspect of things .,2,2
"OMG! This product is awesome. I never knew my children can be so quiet when they are playing or reading a book on this device. I love it and it makes them not want to play with your phone anymorte bc what thy find on your phone, they can find on this device. Thank you for this.They have learned a lot already and still learning. Recommended it to all my freinds with children already. Great for the price!",2,2
"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime.",2,2
This is my first kindle. Reading a book always been a pleasure but now is awesome.,2,2
"we love this Fire Tv, just hard to find shows for now.",2,2
My original Kindle was no longer working. It was 6 years old and had been used a lot. . I especially like the smaller size of my new Kindle and the backlight.,2,2
"As an OEM replacement, I suppose its worth a bit more but this price is excessive. A similar product for my Amazon fire was purchased at Walmart for about 3",1,0
My granddaughter loves it best thing ever I highly recommend it,2,2
I a few of them for gifts for Christmas. I love mine and I thought they would enjoy them too.,2,2
Very helpful product that is fun to use and easy to use,2,2
The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!,2,2
I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well,0,1
We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.,2,2
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.,2,2
Amazon tablet is great to have. Now I wish I bought more gb.,2,2
It does what it is suppose to. No problems with it...,2,2
"Bought for husband's grandmother. Works great for her, she has not called for help after setting it up with her:)",2,2
"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",0,2
Tablet was purchased on sale and worth it.It holds a good amount of memory. Lots of games can be downloaded.,2,2
Bought this tablet for our family to use. Does a great job and my son uses it for videos and games and school apps. The parental controls were a little difficult and time consuming to set up but other than that it has been great! I would definately buy again.,2,2
for an inexpensive tablet it works great. does the basics very well.,2,2
I love this product it is well worth the money that I paid for it.,2,2
"Though I was leary of paying that much for a streaming device, it is well worth the price.",2,2
"Originally purchased the fire TV Stick, upgraded for more bandwith and storage, awesome product.",2,2
This is a great little android box. Already had one but when I found out it was on sale I bought another. Just sideload kodi onto it and it has everything you need. Wired connection to the internet is a must for streaming HD content.,2,2
Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again,2,2
I got me the echo and my daughter the dot. The echo is loud but she can be a helpful tool if I need a quick answer to a problem.,2,2
"Works great! Get all my shows and movies. Even gets my hockey channels. 4K, 1080p, HD, and standard viewing options. So worth it, i bought 2 more!!!",2,2
"I am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the Kindle Paperwhite products. Upon reading about the Voyage, I knew I had to have one. Although it's a bit pricey for an e-reader, it's definitely worth it for me. As much as I read, I believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. It's a beauty to look at. Especially when held next to the Paperwhite 2nd gen and compared.",2,2
My wife bought one at Best Buy. I had to go back and get her $40 dollars when the price went from $179 to $139. I decided I would get her one -- but they were out of stock. I ordered one thru Amazon --- but it still hasnt gotten here.,0,0
I love the Amazon Echo. This is a great product that simplifies the Automation in home.,2,2
My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!,2,2
His product is exactly what we thought it would be. No complaints,2,2
"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.",2,2
I bought this as an exchange Gift for Christmas!!! My Mom fought over it and eventually won it! She Loves It!!!,2,2
"The longer i have this product the more i use it. My most useful feature is the list capabilities. I just say alexa add "" "" to my shopping list and when i got the the store i'm able to pull everything up. It makes life easier for sure. highly recommend everyone to have one.",2,2
The white background makes it easier to read a book. The small size makes it easy to take on the go.,2,2
"This is a nice basic tablet for those not wanting to spend a lot of $$. Easy to use, nice HD resolution for games and even watching Netflix etc.",2,2
"This is larger than the dot but it provides a nice built-in speaker. I use it in my bedroom, where there are no external receiver/speakers and leave the dot downstairs connected to a larger speaker.",2,2
Easy to install and worked great - highly recommend,2,2
It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.,2,2
This device is slick looking. Connects to the network easily and if very fast. I does the job really well.,2,2
Excellent product with decent sound and form factor.,2,2
So far it works well. I don't use it to control any lights or smart devices as I am in a temporary residence. But it responds well and is clear. It some time comes on by itself.,2,2
"My kids love it they watch their programs when they want and also we don t have to miss any programs also we can watch them when ever we have time, best purchase I have brought.",2,2
"I have bought 2 tablets for my son and didn't open it after I received it because it was a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their Big day 1 of the tablet didn't turn on ,the screen is just purple I m out of country right now and will be back on August 4,2107 and I emailed BEST BUY ""Geek Squad "" and told them the whole situation but nobody responded,very disappointed it was a surprise gift for my kiddos and 1 of my son was really upset that tablet won't turn on,let's see if Best Buy read my review and take some action !!!",0,0
"I bought it for my son, who really loves to read. He is very happy with it. It has a nice design, screen is very comfortable to look at. And it's lightweight. Perfect for home use and travel.",2,2
"One of the simplest tablets probably out there, only good for those that want to get into Amazon.com shopping. Good value for bargain proce.",1,2
"Bought as a Christmas gift, everything seems great.",2,2
"I bought two of these for my parents while they were visiting. These were an excellent choice as my parents are older. Being able to adjust the font size, the backlit display touch screen all easy to use features. My parents read alot and have said many times now how much they enjoy them.",2,2
"I love my Amazon Echo and have already purchased a 2nd one for me and 3 more to give as gifts. The sound is great and it's so easy to learn to use. We love the versatility of playing music, setting timers and alarms, giving me the latest sports scores of my favorite teams, and making shopping and To Do lists to share between us.",2,2
"Most tablets in this price range have the quality to show for it. That is not the case with this unit.While only $50, it feels more sturdy and acts more responsive and capable than other bargain tablets that fit into the same price range.The amazon app store has a lot of great options and the popular apps you would expect from apple or Googles app stores. The only downside is the navigation. Even then, it is only a personal problem as I am used to Google play.All in all, this is a great tablet at an even greater price!",2,2
"A present for my wife, she says she really enjoys the larger screen.",2,2
"I have one myself and I bought 2 more as Christmas gifts while they were on sale. Sometimes Alexa has a hard time giving you the answer. I guess I have to work on how I have to ask to get the correct response. Otherwise, I enjoy Alexa Echo.",2,2
Does what it's supposed to do. On the spot hands free entertainment system.,2,2
Great product and like the features of it. It makes carrying a book obsolete.,2,2
"Santa brought this for my 8 almost 9 year old for Christmas. Santa would have rather brought her an Apple but cost for one is too crazy to spend on one child so this was a good alternative and she loves it! She mainly uses it for games and YouTube videos. I think the graphics are great for someone her age. Great starter for children,",1,2
It is only a USB 5 Watt charger. Had now issues with the actual unit as it produced 4.6 watts on a check load but comparing it to what is available to do the same thing there are cheaper options. So minus one star for over priced and that it doesn't come with a cable,2,0
We recently purchased this as a gift for charity. We chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. It's very easy set up and super user friendly. I would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.,2,2
"This device helped in my decision to cut the cord. Works great, abundant material to watch, especially with prime.",2,2
I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,1,2
Excellent speakers for this price range. Combines Bluetooth playback and streaming services. Alexa voice commands are a very convenient way to navigate and get general information.,2,2
"This product is amazing.If you are thinking of or are already transitioning to a Smart Home the Echo is a must. It turns the inconvenience of opening different apps to work your home into a one stop station that does it all.Compared to Google Home it currently has more compatible brands, which is really nice because the chances of you buying a product that is not compatible is slim.This product is much better than the Amazon Dot. The Dot is riddled with issues in addition to being less responsive and much more frustrating. I have both in my home, go with the Echo tower.",2,2
Use my tablet everyday. No problems. Easy to carry,2,2
"My 15 year daughter love her gift, even when the apps are limited its good for the affordable price.",2,2
"I spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen; when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text. Cross-book text searching is a great feature, if you need it, too.",2,2
I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!,2,2
Love that you can take this anywhere and hook up to my Bluetooth. Great sound quality.,2,2
"I didn't know much about the dot/echo but when a friend showed it to me, it seemed like a great gift for my husband who is hard to buy for. It's something you could live without but once you have it, you're so glad you do!",2,2
Enjoying being able to see the words on the kindle everywhere. Being able to dim is also a wonderfuI feature,2,2
"Ha my anticipated my purchase having to wait to purchase it, I read a great deal and it did not disappoint. I love my Echo!",2,2
"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.",2,2
The amazon fire is a great value for the money. Lots of functionality for under $50.,2,2
Best investment ever. No more cable. Glad I decided to get this.,2,2
"Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice",2,2
love the fire tv box. its faster and runs a little better than the firestick. Both are great products. love that you can add 3rd party apps to them for even more movie and tv options.,2,2
"This is my 2nd unit. I liked the first one that my son gifted me so much, I got this second unit for the downstairs. The fact that it was 50% off form BestBuy didn't hurt either.",2,2
I love the Amazon Echo. We are having so much fun with it and it was so easy to set up. We're still learning all it can do. I was very satisfied with Best Buy's service and delivery also.,2,2
I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.,2,2
Easy setup and the Echo voice activated searches is a nice touch. Good set of applications as well.,2,2
This tablet was purchased for a 10 year old but anyone could benefit from it. Very easy to use. Processing speed is good for a bargain tablet. Battery lasts a long time. Overall a great starter tablet.,2,2
Son loves it........................................,1,2
I love so far. processes at decent speed I've been able to do what I need without problems. I only wish all the apps on screen didn't have to be visible. Can't enjoiy a screen saver if its covered with icons,2,2
Like it except that it wont call people for me when hooked up to bluetooth. Would be nice to be able to call out.,2,2
Gave this product to my nephews and they love it. Easy to carry and easy to use.,2,2
"I like my ECHO, she however will talk on her own sometime. Still getying used to it. We mainly use it fir the bluetooth so we can play mudic from Pandora and Youtube.",2,2
"Easy to set up and easy to use. My only complaint is that even with the 32g scan card, it fills up quickly.",2,2
The Amazon Echo was recommended by our IT department at work and is easy to use. Alexa is smart and usually right. Highly recommended.,2,2
"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.",2,2
"It was a gift for 10 year old granddaughter. She is enjoying it very much and can do all she wants (games, music) without any issue.",2,2
Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.,2,2
"Lots of fun, but also very useful. Have it connected to my Nest Thermostat and going to connect it to my Casta Wireless switches. The speaker has great bass for its size. Search YouTube videos for tips and tricks. It does more then you think,",2,2
"Got this for my 70 year old mother for Christmas. She is intimidated by most tech but wanted easy internet access. Got her the Alexa along with the 8"" kindle. It was very easy to set up and easy to teach her how to use it. The speaker quality is really very good....much better then I expected. Streaming music and basic info requests are very simple. Not sure if this unit will get to all it's capabilities but it's just what we needed to get some tech into mom's house. Only down side is now I think I need one at home too!",2,2
Super inexpensive and easy to use. Great for my kids.,2,2
"All apps I like for free, great video quality for Netflix, easy to order from Amazon site.",2,2
"This product is really useful, got to use it at a hotel.",2,2
Ok device for the asking price. Would give as first time user,1,2
This the best streaming device out there. If your looking for a great and fast streaming device this it it for sure. You can't go wrong with it. Super fast and no buffering,2,2
"I purchased this item for the home automation integration. Its pretty cool for just saying ""Alexa, turn on my kitchen lights"". Integrates with all the large players in home automation, Wink, Smartthings, Philips Hue, etc. Its also works well as a bluetooth speaker, streaming from your phone or tablet. It also streams Pandora and radio stations via TuneIn.It doesn't do anything useful other than that, besides simple queries about weather, etc.",1,2
Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids,2,2
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.,2,2
"I've had the product for over 6 months now. No problems, great picture even in the sun, great battery life.",2,2
Bought this on Black Friday and have not looked back! Love it,2,2
"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself.",2,2
I like the kindle. The only thing is there's a little light fluctuation at the bottom of the screen.,2,2
I got a great deal on this tablet after Thanksgiving. It is for a friend that's not to tech savvy. She will use it to watch movies and read books. It already has all of the apps on it that she will use.,2,2
Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,2,2
Great product easy to use. Having different color choices wonderful.,2,2
"This is a great amazon tablet for the people whoe just want to use it to read, browse the internet, or play games.",2,2
"Good value for the price, basic tablet for every day use.",2,2
Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.,2,2
I have enjoyed becoming familiar with all the services available on my kindle!,2,2
Great product and would buy again. Awesome for streaming,2,2
"Functional, but be sure the the USB cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection.",1,2
if you are a college student or just want to go and cut off your primary cable to save money go for it. It will have a little getting use to and everything isn't as clear as you would want it to be but it is definitely due able for watching tv shows and movies....,2,2
This is so affordable and we use it everyday! Our kids use it to watch kid videos on prime and kid apps. We bought a super tough case for it and it has lasted a long time.,2,2
"Fast, easy, and mobile! Connects through WiFi and directly. Easy to move from one room to another.",2,2
My grandchildren will love them. Christmas gifts..,2,2
All w o raked f reat,2,2
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!,2,2
"Hats off to Amazon - The Echo I started with - not have 2 Dots too in the home. Music, alarms, to do list, shopping list and just home automation is awesome! I'm in the 22nd Century now!!!!",2,2
This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome,2,2
"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",2,0
"My daughter always want one, she got this one, she love it.",2,2
"Love my new Kindle FIRE, & LOVE the reasonable price at Best Buy!!!!!!!",2,2
"Best one yet, super speed, great pictures, 4k is awesome!",2,2
"I've enjoyed the original Kindle (with keyboard) for many years, and it was finally time to upgrade. The light is great, and I use the page press buttons exclusively. Very happy with the size, weight, and appearance of this product.",2,2
Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature,2,2
Bought two of these as gifts they are well worth it. They withstand falls as well which is a plus.,2,2
This amazon echo is simply amazing and a must have for any person and it pairs we with the harmony remote simply wireless,2,2
Excellent product. I did extensive research before purchasing my new kindle. This is the third kindle I've had. Only problem with kindle is that their charging port becomes loose and will not charge your kindle.,2,2
"This was a gift for the wife, we have had kindled since the original and this is just a book lovers dream",2,2
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",2,1
I got it to store all my college books without checking to see if they would even be compatible. They weren't. It's my fault for not checking this. The three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for less and use the kindle app. Which is what I did. I can now read my books and have a fully functional tablet.,1,0
"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better.",2,2
"I am truly enjoying my Echo. She does way more things than I thought she could do. I love being able to just ask her something and she finds it. Whether it is to play music, find a radio station, or put on the news or whether. My husband is not very savvy with technology, but I have found him using her as well. She is a great companion to have in the house. I am looking forward to learning more about what she can do.",2,2
I bought several of these tablets for my grandchildren. They love it!,2,2
Easy to use (and fun too!).Great for math and history questions and perfect for making a shopping list.,2,2
It perfect gift to my cousin for this thanksgiving. She love it :),2,2
Great over the top device. The Alexa integration is a major plus.,2,2
This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!,2,2
"Within the low price range, this tablet is excellent for watching TV, movies or reading a book. PROS: very sharp display, fast screen response, fair speaker, low price.CONS: need adding memory in form of micro-sd cards and becoming an Amazon Prime member to make this tablet worthwhile.",2,2
Easy to use. Lightweight and just right for a child. Screen provides great pics and connects easily to internet. Great buy!,2,2
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one,2,2
"So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books.",2,2
Great little device to save money. Streams live and on demand TV. Great way to save money on TV subscriptions,2,2
"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",0,1
Great tablet for a great price. Timely & free shipping,2,2
I did not use this product I gave it as a present.,1,2
My wife just opened this for Christmas. She is enjoying it so far. Looks and operates as good as any we have seen recently. So far so good.,2,2
Easy to get started. Great variety of apps. Price very attractive..,2,2
"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile.",2,2
I've always been a Roku user but when Directv Now came out recently and wasn't available on Roku but was on Fire TV I gave it a try. I've been very happy with it and have switched all my Roku's out with Fire TV's.,2,2
We have been looking into buying it for kids for some time and they love it,2,2
It's has all of the best services and now with Alexa and 4K it's even better,2,2
i really enjoy this product the costumer service was great on helping me pick the right item and explain it to me well i cont to have great experience at best buy.,2,2
This is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.,2,2
"I just love my echo, I have taught her a ton of new tricks.",2,2
My daughter loves it. Its is a very good tablet for her,2,2
This item is no good... will only last for 3 months & amazon basically tells you to f*** off,0,1
For the price even without the Black Friday price of $35 this is a solid tablet. The new UI for Amazon tablets is much better and it runs smooth. Apps are butter and there is no lag in navigation of the home screen or between apps. I bought this for my little sisters ages 5 & 7 and my parents love the parental controls limiting play time on the tablet. The full experience comes only if you have Amazon prime which is also highly recommended,2,2
"I have had a kindle for years. After my husbands was stolen we had to get another. The setup is easy, getting books couldn't be any easier, I even get free books through my library which download through Amazon. Would be lost without my Kindle.",2,2
"Can use it for facebook, or email and of course to read my books in a series. Love it.",2,2
"Bought it for my mother. Relatively user friendly for someone not too familiar with smart phones and such. She seems to like it although she complains about the speed and size of the screen at times. She also likes the size though since it can easily fit in a medium to large purse. The touch screen is responsive and it has the essentials that she needs. It feels and looks nice. The App Store is ok for simple use. It's a great price for a simple, beginner, or kids tablet. I would probably purchase something more powerful for my own use.",2,2
"Still learning all that the Amazon Echo can do. Keeps my calendar, my to do list, and entertains me. She helps with my budget with You Need a Budget and much more with all the available apps.Love the Amazon Echo. Can't wait to find out all she can do.",2,2
I am extremely satisfied with this tablet for the price I paid. It was inexpensive and it works wonderfully. I recommended it to my sister who also purchased one.,2,2
We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!,2,2
Alexis had to learn news skills before it was useful. Getting better,2,2
Nice unit - easy to setup and initialize. I like the availability of the secure digital memory card - can put my music and movies on the card and not take up the internal memory.,2,2
Now I can use my Kindle. Works great,2,2
We got 2 kindle fires for our girls and we love them :) great purchase.,2,2
I take this with me when I don't want to carry heavy books. White background much easier to read than original gray.,2,2
Works great was a gift for daughter she loves it!!,2,2
Very useful and helpful techs at Best Buy. Cost was average,2,2
The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design.. It still has a 1.14 HDMI port.. you need at least a 2.0 dvd port to receive a 4k signal.. You wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution.. there you will see it still displaying in 1080p.,0,0
"At first I thought it would be just another one of the voice interfaces that are on a lot of devices - It only comes with a few functions. Wow I never was so happy to be proved wrong. The omni-directional microphones and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home. Because of its open source code you can add skills that other users have developed or download a SDK and make your own. It reads me bedtime stories filters my content for news sources according to my whim add complex sums, spells and is an all around good sport. But the best thing is -- I had a few remote control hubs around wink, nest the house because I hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than completing the task myself. Echo changed all that it unified my security, locks, my lights and more through an easy voice interface -- I could not be more happy - it gave me more than a smart house - it gave me a smart home. I even bought a second unit to take on vacation- Definitely will change your life for the better",2,2
I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet,2,2
I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!,2,2
Completely satisfied. Works as it should.,2,2
Amazon echo is a really cool device to have around the house especially if you have a smart home,2,2
Very happy that I can finally view HDR content on Amazon and Netflix with this. Only gripe I have is navigating thru this software is a little confusing. Not too bad though.,2,2
Better price point than apple TV but in comparison for what I am interested in prefer Apple TV,1,2
Still learning how to get the most out of my new Echo but so far it is fun and very useful and informative.,2,2
"I bought for the wife, she's still using her old one. don't know why",2,2
I bought several of the Amazon Tablets as gifts and my family and friends were ecstatic! I have not given a gift with such great reception in a while.,2,2
Functions as expected,2,2
I bought this for e-reading. Easy to use. easy access to Amazon for books.,2,2
"does everything i need plenty of apps to download along with books and movies, with Prime, great bonus",2,2
"best bang for the buck out there,works fast, easy on the wallet, just an all around easy to understand and operate product.",2,2
This kindle is perfect for using on my commute. It is extremely lightweight and easy to use and it fits just about in any of my bags.,2,2
"Everytime I give one of these as a gift, it is worth so much more than the $40 I paid for it. Durable and lasts a really long time. Great for kids.",2,2
"This product was a great one, and the tablet does everything I wanted it to. Some of the websites I go to don't open but other than that it is great I love it.",2,2
Echo works great and she is much funnier then Siri for sure and they are expanding her capacity all the time. Well worth the money,2,2
Our household enjoys this fun gadget. I recommend this.,2,2
Very good tablet for only $30. My wife uses for apps such as Pinterest and Facebook and she loves it.,2,2
but the skills could use a bit of a refresh. can't remember all the commands as skills require certain keywords. the whole point of amazon echo is to be able to say anything.still fun and great if you have a lot of home automation gadgets.,2,2
I would definitely recommend this for everyone. It is awesome.,2,2
Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful,2,2
Kids love playing games on the tablet - fast for an inexpensive tablet.,2,2
I've been streaming Wi-Fi for a long time this is my 4th device. It is easily the best so far. It is very easy to use and set up and there is a ton of information you can use on You tube. After several ventures on line and down-loads I'm almost reagy to get rid of cable. In a few months I should have saved enough to go to Best Buy and get a new TV.,2,2
This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids,2,2
Had the firetv stick and wanted something a little more powerful that also had the capability of playing 4k content. Much smoother experience overall with the firetv.,2,2
Excellent Product . Easy set up and has endless possibilities. Great product for all ages.,2,2
"I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter, and she can't put it down!",1,2
"Great shows, fabulous quality, highly recommended, good price.",2,2
Great tablet for kids but you have to keep your eye on them to protect them,2,2
This is honestly a little expensive. And I can find other ways to charge my devices.,0,2
"The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability.",2,2
"I purchased the Fire TV box over the Fire Stick because the box supports 4K video. There isn't a lot out there yet, but I've been able to watch 4k programming from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm using the Netflix, Hulu and FXNow apps -- Amazon Prime is built in. I also downloaded the free VLC app to stream video from my computer. I may end up getting a second one for another TV. Very happy with the Fire Box.",2,2
This is really the standard when it comes to ereaders. Super light weight and crystal clear.,2,2
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games.",2,2
I started out liking the tablet but having to change a lot of the settings. It works good but I really did not like the advertisements that were appearing.,1,2
"If your a prime member this is a must have. It does a great job streaming all of your prime media and your personal media. It does a great job with Netflix too, so if your an Amazon fan this is the box for you.",2,2
"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility",2,2
I have loved my echo this far. Alexa has so many skills that are super helpful. I do love the mute option too because sometimes shes picks up when Alexa commercials come on so I can just mute her.,2,2
This is the BEST tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!!,2,2
Great tablet for the money. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or Hulu movies and read books on Hoopla. The picture is great and suits my needs. The sound is not the best but its okay.,2,2
"It's a nice fast table with upgradable memory. App store provided by amazon is ok limited good apps. It's not google or IOS store but still ok. Screen resolution is great in HD streaming work really well. I recommend this tablet because it is also easy to hold, very thin and light.",2,2
Very good speakers. Gets synced quickly and provides weather updates as well,2,2
"Believe it or not, I purchased this for my 3 year old Grandson, and he is doing real fine with it.",2,2
"I purchased the Amazon Echo to use in the house and I haven't been disappointed. It plays music, gives me weather and answers most questions. My family has found it very handy to have around.",2,2
"I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted.",2,2
This does everything i need and want it to do. All extras in one place.,2,2
Received the echo dot last year and bought this as well. Love it!,2,2
Needs more apps and has bugs that need fixing.....,1,2
"I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!",2,2
"Fire Tv is the best stream box in the market, it's really easy to setup and if you are a prime member you'll love it",2,2
Easy to use tablet. Battery life is good. No issues so far,2,2
I bought four of these for my children to replace the RCA tablets that no longer worked. They load much faster and the battery last longer on a single charge. The are very durable and worth the money!,2,2
"Wish it would have more access to more info and after paying so much for device, we got more services for free. Seems very expensive to purchase device and have to pay per month to get music, books and etc.",2,2
This is a great little tablet even with all the ads. Should have paid the extra money to not have the ads but still a great buy,2,2
"I purchased this for my daughter in the car. I didn't think I would like kids mode, but I hands found it to be useful. Amazon tweaked android and not for the better but it is still manageable. All things considered this is a cheap tablet but for a kid who cares.",2,0
Im still not sure why this doesn't come with the Kindle - and Im glad I threw it in the shopping cart when I purchased my Kindle.,2,2
I also have a fire and like it's overall performance.,2,2
This is a replacement machine. Good reading experience. Great for travel - and reading in bed.,2,2
Kindle Voyage is absolutely the best! Easy to read in sunlight!Ordered from Best Buy and it shipped immediately!,2,2
Absolutely the best purchase I have made this year.,2,2
Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks,1,2
I purchased this as a gift for my parents. It's easy for them to maneuver.,2,2
Already lost the cord. It should be longer so u don't forget it. Especially on vacation.,2,2
"I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!",2,2
Like talking to a human! Can find an answer for most subjects as long as the internet is available. Fairly accurate also.,2,2
I need tablets that were cheap but had the processing speed that I needed to run certain apps. My children actually use them (I bought two because they were so cheap) and I have yet to have any problems. I love the individual profiles... Initally I didn't have any parental setting on there but my son quickly started purchasing books and such that he liked with my money.... Hence the individual profiles and limited access and a password on my profile. I'd recommend this product because of the price and functionality of the product. I love it and my kids do too.,2,2
Great product I was excited to get it. I encouraged others to purchase one.,2,2
Bought for my three kids and so far there are no complaints. Easy to use!,2,2
Great to group all your program app into one device.,2,2
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product,2,2
Not bad for an entry level consumer. Decent for kids (with a bumper) and adults that aren't super tech savvy.,2,2
"I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing.",1,0
The item is great also great for kids for the price you can't beat it.,2,2
Great purchase. Easy to operate and smooth transaction.,2,2
"My 86-year-old aunt has an Echo and she recommended that I get one. I enjoy the information, entertainment, and help it is able to provide.",2,2
Bought this for my daughters elderly friend across the street. She loves it.,2,2
Needed for a friend that is blind and it is great for audible books.,2,2
Excellent product I would recommend to anyone. Very happy,2,2
Purchases as a gift for my niece in the Caribbean. As soon as I gave it to them they hooked it up ti the wifi and was ready to go. They enjoyed every minute of it,2,2
"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters.",2,2
Purchased this for Christmas for my daughter. Its small size allows it to be easily carried around and handled and she will enjoy reading kindle books on it.,2,2
You get a multitasking tablet for an incredible price!,2,2
Great $50 tablet that I don't have to worry about kids breaking. Easy to use (if you can operate an Ipad you can use this),2,2
"This camera is a little thicker than other ""pocket"" cameras, primarily due to the fold-out LCD screen. The screen is a nice feature as it provides additional stability when in the ""out"" position. The zoom capability and image stabilization features are also very good.",2,2
Bought this item for my son because the last one needed replacing. Easy to use to read books and do internet searches.,2,2
We bought this for our 7 year old daughter and it is perfect!!,2,2
"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.",0,0
Works great. Having a physical internet connection works great for streaming,2,2
"good low light readability, battery life is fantastic. It's all i could ask for at such a low cost",2,2
"I bought this tablet for my 6 year old son. The tablet has a nice screen resolution, stay charged for a long period of time and carries a lot of free apps. For the price you are definitely getting more than what you are paying for. I have purchased this item for all 3 of my kids they never complain about the tablet not working or freezing.",2,2
Very easy to use. Many various apps available. Great for reading and games. I would highly recommend it as a very easy use tablet for beginners and children.,2,2
Small and useful has an expandable memory. Very user friendly !,2,2
You find may uses for Echonfrom news flash to adding appointments to you calendar.,2,2
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages,2,2
"I got this tablet for my 20 month old son. He constantly wants my phone or iPad to watch YouTube kids videos. He can work both of these apple devices all on his own. I figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. No luck. The Fire is not as user-friendly as my iPhone. Even on the child setting it is not easy to use. The surface is not as responsive to touch. He gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. Now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my iPad and phone. If you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an iPad.",1,0
Not as quick as my iPad but a great solution for traveling. Some of the apps that you get on an iPad are unavailable. Happy purchaser!,2,2
This is a great product. It still needs better AI to make it more user friendly. I also have a Google Home. They each have their own strong points.,2,2
Love this product. Very fast and no buffering lag.,2,2
I like it because it easy to use and easy to install,2,2
Great reader for the price. Good battery life. A little smaller than I expected but is well built.,2,2
"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults.",1,2
Waited quite a while before buying this Kindle reaader. Weighed it heavily against an iPad. Talked to friends about their experiences with reeaders. The Kindle just seemed l8ike it would do the job I wanted much betterand the price was fantastic. I have beeen pleasantly surprised with what a Kindle can accomplish and how easy it is to use.,2,2
Set up really easy. We cancelled cable right away. Still figuring out which apps are for us. Got antenna for local channels.,2,2
"The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles.",2,2
The sound is amazing and it lives up to all the hype.,2,2
"is simple and easy to use, also is perfect size for my purse or a carry on bag",2,2
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.",2,2
Love it! Best e reader I have owned so far and I've owned quite a few,2,2
Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend.,2,2
It has everything I need and the size makes it easy to read.,2,2
Very fast response to the different apps and looks great with my 4K tv,2,2
bought this for my wife for mothers day to replace another tablet that was tough to use as a reader outdoors. Battery last a long time which is good on long road trips.,2,2
"Good box, but menu slow when booting up and control loses sync at times.",2,2
Hate using cable very easy to use. Family is enjoying using it.,2,2
"They love it, works like it should without too many issues",2,2
If you have Amazon Prime I would Recommend. . It is equally build and quality is good. Interface is nice and easy. Games not so good.,2,2
"It was so easy to setup and to use, I would buy this for a gift",2,2
"My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his",2,2
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,1,2
"The Amazon Echo is the first smart home purchase we've made. So far she's been quite a bit of fun. She's not so smart all the time, we tend to ""Alexa, Wikipedia ...."" we love listening to Audible books, and prime music. I have my Google Calendar synced and she tells me upcoming engagements. She understands very well for the most part, as expected she doesn't always understand what our 5 year old says. Amazon is constantly updating what she can do. We'll eventually get more smart home items, (light bulbs, thermostat, etc) . So far she's been fun to have around.",2,2
My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.,2,2
I've use the Amazon fire tv and the Roku. The Amazon fire box In my opinion is easier to use and I prefer the Amazon remote over the Roku. The only problem I've had with Amazon fire would be the life of the batteries in the remote.,2,2
"Easy to use, lots of apps. So far have really enjoyed!",2,2
It works great for all my needs to check my emails,2,2
Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.,2,2
This Echo is very cool. Great sound and ease of use makes this a great buy!,2,2
For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.,2,2
"I love that the Echo responds well to anything I say. Weather, traffic, sports are all easy to ask for. I can't wait to begin hooking up my lights and other home electronics to it.",2,2
"Great speaker, great sound quality, gets super loud. Alexa is helpful and can really do a lot. Highly recommend toanyone",2,2
Perfect item for our autistic grandson. He absolutely loves it.,2,2
"Pros: The E-Ink display is easy on the eyes, very sharp. Great battery life.Cons: Dependant on Amazon's Infrastructure to manage. Because of that limitation I give it 3 stars.",1,2
"Love, love, love it! I check all news, weather forecast, listen to music, listen to newspaper/ magazine reviews, buy stuff etc. How did I live without Alexa /Echo?",2,2
This is my 2nd. kindle and wouldn't go without one for any length of time.Great to bring along on a trip and easy for anyone to use.,2,2
This product works very well and the price is reasonable.,2,2
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,2,2
Really enjoying this little guy bought two for my mom and daughter,2,2
my daughter loves her tablet she got it for christmas and has lots of fun with her own games,2,2
I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it,2,2
The Echo works very well for the music lover and children that like to ask it questions. I tried it out for a few weeks and I decided it wasn't for me. I seldom listen to music unless I'm in my car. It was too much money to just sit there idle. It is a great product for the right person and it has a lot of potential.,2,2
Easy to carry all your books in one place. You will never get distracted when using kindle.,2,2
I was satisfied with tablet and size and clarity!!,2,2
Great beginner tablet. Used for my kid to view videos.,2,2
Everything you could ever need at the sound of your voice. So easy to set up.,2,2
"Great to set timers, play music, look up scores, etc. I wish it could access my weather app (dark sky) when I asked about rain to give me a more precise answer.",2,2
Great product. It was on sale and I didn't think it was going to be great but it was,2,2
A little faster than the firestick and has 4k. Can only do 4k at 30hz and 4k is not in the menu screens. (Can be a little confusing when thinking the device is entirely 4k when you turn it on and your tv says it's only 1080p and you have 4k enabled on a 4k tv.,2,0
I love my Echo. You can ask it most everything and get an answer. Plays music with great sound!,2,2
i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd,2,2
I started with the original kindle- loved it but light was bright on the cover for night reading. Then got the fire as a gift and love that but reads more like on a tablet.. Broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night- great light to dim for night reading. Very light too!,2,2
"This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!",2,2
I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE,2,2
It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.,2,2
excelent costumer service i love the store you will find everything,2,2
"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!",2,2
"Great e-reader, has a built in back light for reading in low light and in the dark.",2,2
It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.,2,2
Bought four of these for our grand children and they love them. Great price too.,2,2
"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one",2,2
"I ""upgraded"" from my Kindle Fire to the Paperwhite! I couldn't be happier with my decision.",2,2
I had a tablet that was stolen and I was happy to replace it with this one it is just as nice and easy to use!,2,2
"All my grand kids have one is the best entertainment for all my 7 grad kids, from 5 to 19 years old. I love this product.",2,2
Works fine and I am pleased with my purchase. I would purchase again.,2,2
Purchased fire stick along with fire tv and tv works better,2,2
"Yes, it's that much fun to use and you'll wonder how you functioned in life without the Echo of Amazon?",2,2
I got it on black friday. Its a great tablet for Kids or your additional backup tablet for games or reading books. Ad's on the lock screen was annoying.,2,2
This was a gift and we are still learning all it can do.,2,2
Works smooth and easy will recommend to friends and family,2,2
"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.",1,0
I bought the Fire as a gift for a friend who loves to play games. This is the perfect size and functions well for his purpose and more. This is a great tablet for the price!,2,2
Saves my phone battery ever since I'm using my Alexa.,2,2
the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.,2,2
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display,2,2
Good to get additional accessories on Thanks giving...,2,2
This is a great tablet! My nephews really enjoy using it.,2,2
Really like the touch screen factor. Really lights up easy to read especially since you can enlarge the font,2,2
Purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. She loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. She loves the device and the pink color; I loved the price and the fast delivery .,2,2
I bought 3 for our 3 oldest Grandkids ages 7 to 10 and they loved them! Very easy for them to set up themselves and get started using them with very little help from thier parents. Great product for the price.,2,2
"My wife's laptop bit the dust and I needed a low-cost solution so she could read her email and surf the net. This device does the job. I was impressed with the quality for $50. I have no complaints. Cheap, easy to use and keeps the wife happy. Good deal!",2,2
Alexa is so much better than Siri. More natural and faster.,2,2
"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!",2,0
I love that even great quality product like this is available to masses who can actually afford them. The table does it job really good. And i'm happy with my purchase.,2,2
"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.",0,2
Works just like it says it does. Would recomend this to anybody!,2,2
amazon fire tv box is awesome i love using netflix in 4k!,2,2
"My 4k tv has an android Amazon app., but it does not include all the features that the box has. The up-scaling of 1080p to 4k is incredible!",2,2
"Got this as an early Christmas present. The sound it pretty good for a small speaker. We now have Echo controlling the lights, furnace and the A/V system. Set up is easy.",2,2
I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.,2,2
"I like the product. It works great. It is just what we were looking for. However, we had to sign up for the Amazon prime membership just to set up the account to actually use the product. We were not prepared for that.",2,2
"The Fire itself works well so far, the ouch comes from the fact that the buyers Amazon account MUST be hitched to it to download free games. Who wants kids downloading anything that has your credit card attached even if it's free or accessing your account?",1,0
I have a couple kindles so got this one for my mom to replace a tablet I had got her last year. I didn't realize it was smaller than mine but that was my own fault. Works as expected!!,2,2
This is a great option for a first tablet. It's lightweight and user friendly.,2,2
Loved it. Perfect type of lighting and so lightweight!,2,2
"Overall I like the fire TV.The UI could be a better,it could be better organized and easier to navigate.It also pushes Amazon video over other streaming services.Doesn't have as many streaming services as Roku.",2,2
"This certainly isn't the most impressive device out there, but at $40 it is a fantastic value.",1,2
"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it.",2,2
"Lots of Fun!! Useful for New, Weather and Alarms - Great Speakfor for the size - Easy to Set up",2,2
"This is a great device for streaming content to your TV. If you have an Amazon Prime account, definitely a must buy. Worth the extra money over the Fire Stick.",2,2
I received this as a Christmas present. This is great to take on a trip or to work. It is great for watching movies or reading books. It was easy to setup.,2,2
"Incredible knowledge Alexa has, sports, weather, trivia, simply amazing! Need to hook up my music to it!",2,2
bought it to an alternative to the apple tv works amazing and best of all it was on the cheap,2,2
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.,2,2
This is my second tablet and it's a great starter tablet. If you have a prime account it's even better. The Prime video allows you to download videos for later viewing.,2,2
Thus device is so portable and works really well for what I want it to.,2,2
Provides television options without the cost of cable. Easy to setup and use.,2,2
"Works good but, you can purchase a charger with same or better specs. on Amazon MUCH cheaper. I purchased a 5 port 30 watt charger for about 1/2 of the cost of this.",2,2
"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!",2,2
Setup was very simple. I can actually hide it behind TV and still use remote. I was surprised how fast it boots up. Makes my TV a smart TV that allows many more apps than the ones that come built in generally.,2,2
Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.,0,2
Easy to set up Plays movies from Amazon Prime with no problem Great tablet for the price,2,2
"I have owned exactlo, nooks, kobo's and kindles. This is the Cadillac of readers!!!",2,2
Purchased as a birthday present for my brother and was an upgrade for a previous model. I did not use is but he loves it.,2,2
Perfect for my 8 year old nephew. He absolutely loves it and uses it everyday!,2,2
"I bought the 7"" Amazon fire tablet for my 3 year daughter to view learning programs and videos. I love it because you can have up to 5 children and 2 adults sign up And create the parental controls level for each of them",2,2
"This is my 2nd Kindle for myself, I bought the 1st one for my wife a week ago, we both love it, most important it wont hurt our eyes and battery last for weeks without charging it",2,2
"Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break.",2,2
"Very good replacement for books. Small, lightweight, and easy to tote around with you. The paperwhite version has a sharper screen then the regular. Thank you Best Buy for a pleasant transaction.",2,2
I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy.,2,2
"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away.",2,2
The box needs a 4k tv for maximal viewing pleasure. Will not turn your tv into a 4 k machine. Sure will help a little with graphics. If that where the case people would buy cheaper tvs then this box. And it is much faster than original. I have box for different rooms.,2,2
"This is just a basic kindle fire for my 7 yr old child. It works fine for her. It obviously doesn't have comparable picture quality when compared to the HDX versions, but it still has the same functions. It does have a rear and forward facing camera, making it easy to take pictures of the dog. There are lots of safety features and apps for kids also.",2,2
Thumbs up. This was a good substitute to replace the current cable provider you use. Canadian customers would like this the best.,2,2
"my grandson really loves it, is reading a lot of books already.",2,2
"I found this product let me let go of cable tv and saved me tons of money, since I am on limited income i had to let cable go I kept my High speed internet and use my Fire to watch movies and save Tons of money.",2,2
"It's very light, comfortable to handle and very responsive.",2,2
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!,2,2
I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.,2,2
New Kindle Voyage is a nice upgrade from the basic model. Smaller e reader with a brighter light. So far so good.,2,2
"Bought this tablet as a gift and so far they are happy with it. I did the set up and I can tell you it didnt lag or freeze so thats always a plus. It runs on the amazon app store. I dont care for it cause it dont have as many apps as others. Other than that and the low memory, I like it. Personally I download alot of game apps so i need lots of memeory but for my mother in law its just fine. She likes to read books on it, she says its good for that. Also she was able to get the libraries app and download free books so thats a plus.",2,1
"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate.,2,2
"The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,",2,2
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.,2,2
Love my kindle paperwhite. My first one lasted years and I immediately went and bought a new one and that one no longer worked It's great for night reading with the back light,2,2
MY SO LOVE IT. EXCELENT FOR ENTRETAIMENT. AFFORDABLE PRICE,2,2

Love this product. Will not go back to satellite or cable.,2,2
Easy to install has everything that I need and more!!!!,2,2
"Very affordable tablet,soft led screen impact on the vision.",2,2
still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.,2,2
"This is the second Kindle I have owned. Paperwhite appealed to me for its reader-friendly settings and backlighting. My first Kindle was a keyboard model with no backlight so I used a ""clip in"" light that fit in my M Edge case. I forsook the keyboard this time as I rarely used Kindle for web browsing. I also abandoned my fear of advertising to select the ""special features?"" model. Ads appear only at start up and are quickly and easily dispatched - there's only one ad so all you do is swipe up and it's gone. The new Kindle has exceeded my expectations. After I get books to put on it, I turn off the WiFi and the device will go for weeks without recharging. (Btw, I purchased an inexpensive Fintie case which shuts down Kindle when you close the cover and sends it to sleep - it's never really totally off.) You just have to remember to put your reading on the device itself rather than in the ""cloud"". The backlighting is awesome and the Paperwhite e-ink and font great for older eyes. My only complaint is that the ""collections"" setup is not particularly user friendly and the icons take getting used to on the toolbar. However, I am totally happy with this purchase and glad I updated to Paperwhite.",2,2
I purchased this for my wife her old Kindle fire bite the dust. This unit has better contrast and is easier to use. She loves it.,2,2
Screen is very vibrant and bright great color. Pretty easy to use even for a beginner. It's big enough to see well but easy to hold. Fits in a purse easily.,2,2
Has many functions app or voice controlled. Great speaker qualit,2,2
This an amazing speaker. Absolutely great sound! The capabilities are endless. I would recommend this product to everyone. Very pleased!,2,2
"The screen is beautiful, great for daylight or night. Very soothing in eyes. Kindle has a huge collection of books. If you love books, you will love kindle",2,2
I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It is very easy to operate and it holds plenty of books. It is easy to travel with. I would recommend it to everyone,2,2
My favorite streaming box. Works flawlessly and am very pleased with the item.,2,2
This is just what we needed for a you k8d ..the apps are great,2,2
"I love the size and design. works great, I love that i can change font sizes",2,2
I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they,2,2
So easy to set up and use right away. Dual camera is great.,2,2
"Its Fast, reliable, what else could you ask for! This Bad boy will knock out the competition and get rid of your cable bill for good! Its time to Cut the cord people because Fire TV is the future of entertainment!",2,2
"I bought this to replace my failing Kindle 3 (Keyboard). I absolutely love it! The only con I have found is battery life with airplane mode off. It drains rather quickly with it off, turn airplane mode on and it's great!",2,2
"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price.",2,2
Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.,2,2
I love being able to use voice activation for anything from playing music to making an Amazon purchase.,2,2
"I love the size and the Light, to be able to read, anywhere, anytime!",2,2
This product is great. Very fast and responsive and allows you to cutomize however you feel.,2,2
"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop.",2,2
this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover,2,2
This is not only fun to use but extremely handy to have around the house.,2,2
My daughter loves it and IRS a good and easy size to travel with too,2,2
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!,2,2
The Amazon echo is a wonderful product and I would recommend it to everyone.,2,2
"Worth the purchase, simple to use and easy to set up",2,2
So far it's great. This was a gift. She is gets this on today.,2,2
"Takes getting use to asking the questions in the right way. Alexa is still learning so at times can be frustrating when asking questions. Great for music, weather, dates, and schedule requests. Its an entertaining companion when your home and enjoying some private time.",2,2
"Great product clear video stream, very easy to hook up",2,2
I bought 5 of these and they are really easy to set up and my kids love them; might order one for myself. Bought them on Black Friday for $33/each...should have bought mine then.,2,2
"The Amzon Echo is like a dream come true. Everyone in my house feels like we live in some future movie. We use it everyday to get our news, weather, cooking timer, control our lights, control our AC and listen to music over Spotify, all with just our voice. It's useful to get quick wiki info or even just for a joke. The kids love to play paper rock and scissors with her. My only regret is I don't have another!",2,2
Great price great product would recommend this gift,2,2
This is a product that I believe will be very useful.,2,2
This was purchased for my 7 year old son & he LOVES it!! Perfect sixe for him,2,2
I purchased this for my mom 4 days before Christmas with 2 day free shipping. It arrived on time with no issues. My mom loves it! She likes to read digital books and watch Netflix and this tablet allows her to do both. She also loves that it's small enough to fit in her purse and Bluetooth capable.,2,2
"I love the fire sticks but sometimes not crazy about using wifi. The fire tv can be hard wired, which limits some buffering issues. Not that it's ever really been an issue. It's still really easy to use and setup just like the fire stick.",2,2
I am totally happy with this product for my two year old grandson..he enjoys it when we are all playing on our phones,2,2
"This is used in a work environment. Our tech support team chose this particular tablet for all of us. We use it for contacts, work trail record keeping, and customer support, and are very pleased with how much we can do with it. I say, excellent choice.",2,2
"This was such an awesome purchase. I'm constantly asking her to play different music, sending messages, set timers and even use her just as a speaker for my iPad. She even has learned the music I like and makes suggestions. I plan on purchasing the additions for light switches to utilize it even more.",2,2
Does it job and hope amazon keeps adding more apps,2,2
I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet,2,2
bought for grandkids they love them. wise choice I made,2,2
does everything i need it to do for my business needs,2,2
The Echo is amazing and has already changed how we enjoy our home! From asking Alexa to turn on the lights in the morning to looking up the star of the movie that we are watching The Echo is a valuable asset to our family. I am going to purchase the Dot and we just added a Tap to complete our Smarthome.,2,2
"Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But.",2,2
This is much better than the echo. The sound is great,2,2
"Easy to use, good battery life, great back lighting.",2,2
Easy for my wife to play music she likes by just asking. Works great on Fire Tv. Still hooking up lights and controllers but all has been easy to do.,2,2
"Perfect size, easily readable screen, and crisp text.",2,2
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos,2,2
Bought online Black Friday to avoid in store hassles. Got an option on colors to keep my 3 boys from confusing tablets.,2,2
I love this kindle tablet. Its speed is awesome. And its a great device for young children.,2,2
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.,2,2
My daughter loves her tablet it works really good.,2,2
I bought it for my husband as a birthday gift. It's perfect for his movies.,2,2
"Whether you're a bookworm or a casual reader, the Kindle Paperwhite is a great way to read and discover new and interesting books. Admittedly, I only read infrequently since purchasing my Kindle. I absolutely love the size and abilities of the Kindle and have been reading 4-5 books per month since purchasing it. Highly recommended!",2,2
Bought this as a mothers day gift for mother in law she loves it,2,2
I always take me tablet when I go to get my hair done. It makes time go by faster when I'm under the hair dryer!!,2,2
"Alexa tell me a joke, Alexa play some Christian music",2,2
I love that I can set time limites for my 5 yr old.,2,2
Awesome product great value! I can stream from Netflix and Hulu and is much faster than the FireStick.,2,2
"Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek",2,2
I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.,2,2
Works just as advertised.Easy to set up.Finds music with ease,2,2
I highly recommend this to everyone! Easy to use! Fills the room with music.,2,2
Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient,2,2
Awesome we buy another one ASAP kelly was super helpful in helping me with all my problems...,2,2
We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.,2,2
Have had it for a couple of weeks and really enjoy being able to call up music and have it play without having to go through my phone.,2,2
"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift.",2,2
It is very high quality device. It is easy to set up and very easy to operate. It is a lot of fun.,2,2
Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.,1,2
Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free,2,2
"So happy with my purchase easy to setup and request information, music and anything",2,2
"First, let me say, that I only took one star away, because even after getting I touch installed, my little girl can turn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing buttons. Not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kids edition. Aside from that one single item, this has been an excellent purchase.",2,2
Perfect for travel and home. We have 5 in our house and everyone loves them.,2,2
"Better than expected for the price. Sturdy enough for regular use, fast enough for streaming and fits nicely in the hands or on the lap.",2,2
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!,2,2
Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well,2,2
Meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the Oasis E-Reader.,2,2
"I was using a Roku box and various game consoles before this for Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms but the Amazon Fire TV really is the best option out there currently. The device is fast and responsive, includes tons of different apps and integrations and best of all has Alexa support for search. If you're a Amazon Prime member especially, this device is a must have.",2,2
Got this for Christmas gifts for a few people and each say they love this tablet . For the price it's great .,2,2
My son had the kindle w/o the camera but cracked the screen so we bought the upgrade with the camera. He loves it,2,2
Even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. Feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. Amazon disappointed me with this product. Minor issues in installing the apps which are available in iOS too.,1,0
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.",2,2
"For a reading device, you cannot do better than Kindle. And, if you're going to get a Kindle, get the Paperwhite as the lights on the screen are worth the extra cost over the base model. You will NOT regret it.",2,2
"Bought this as a gift for my mother so that she could watch Netflix and hulu while in the hospital. Took her a bit to get used to as she was used to her ipad but overall I like this product. Only drawback is lack of appstore content (namely clash of clans, clash royale, pokemon go, etc)",2,2
I love the kindle voyage. My favorite feature is that I can read while at the beach!! It's also very lightweight and fits in one hand.,2,2
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!,2,2
Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.,2,2
Easy to setup and use. Even without peripherals the syste interaction was beneficial,2,2
Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!,2,2
This tablet was purchased for a person in their 20's and they are very content with it.,2,2
"The Fire TV fills my need for a streaming device. I'm able to access PS Vue, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other channel apps. The remote and interface are intuitive and simple and Alexa is a nice add-on feature. Much recommended for anyone looking for a streaming device.",2,2
"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",2,2
"If you need help making a decision in what product to buy then hope I can quickly help you make that decision. This is a great product for 90% of us out there. If you have a 4K TV then get the 2016 version of the Fire TV. If you have to decide between a Firestick or a Fire TV then get the Fire TV. The processor speed difference alone is worth the price difference. If you want the best out there then the Nvidia Shield TV is for you. Either way, Amazon made a great product in the Fire TV. Some key features are the microSD expansion, ability to use a controller for some mild gaming, and voice activated remote. Get Prime and have access to all of Amazon's video and music streamin service..",2,2
Love it very much thanks. I use my table for banking,2,2
I am not a tv person but I like the movies and tv content. I love pureflix,2,2
"The Amazon Echo has become a critical appliance in our kitchen. Admittedly we bought the Echo to serve as yet another cool toy to have around...but we're finding that it's a great addition to our lives.The top used function for our family is probably the simple to use timer function, but a close second is the ability to call on any artist we want to hear with Amazon Prime Music. It's well worth a few bucks a month to get the music service and the sound quality of the device (although not audiophile worthy) is quite good.Our family is still exploring the many great tools available with Alexa...but I can say without reservation that it's a great device to have for any household.",2,2
"I had wanted one of these, the price was right so I bought 2 one for me and one for a gift for someone else. I really enjoy it.",2,2
"Very functional device, takes some time making Alexa smarter. Unfortunately it needs to be powered by a wall adapter so you can't take it from room to room...",2,2
It was a gift to our granddaughter for Christmas and she was and is thrilledwith the device. She especially will use the Geek Squad information service.,2,2
This is my 4th Kindle. I love that it can be used in any light... even no light at all. It is small and easy to carry around. Still has all the best features of all the others before it.,2,2
My grandson loves it. He said his games don't freeze up on this one.,2,2
"This was a gift to my husband. It's the only e-reader that can be read in sunlight and since we were going to Hawaii, I thought it'd be nice for him not to have to lug along a bunch of books (I already had my Kindle).",2,2
It work just as good as the tablets that cost much more. If you take care of it it will last a long time.,2,2
"Better than the firestick, works well with prime and simple to use.",2,2
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.",2,2
Touch is not good. Also very limited apps on amazon app store.,1,2
bought this unit as a door price at work . my fellow employees went bananas when they seen this as a prize option. last x- mas I gave away the fire stick and that was a big hit,2,2
Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!,2,2
"Awesome little tablet. It isn't the fastest, but it gets the job done. Bought one for my father and one for myself. He uses it to watch DIY videos on YouTube and online browsing. I do the same and also listen to my Spotify playlists. It's pretty cheap too!",2,2
Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.,2,2
It performs with no major problems and without excessive load times,2,2
Purchased for my mother so she would have something bigger to look at besides her phone. It works wonderful.,2,2
"I am on my 3rd Kindle. This software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage. Only about a fifth of the available space. So this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. Finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. This OS is definitely NOT USER FRIENDLY. It requires a great deal of effort of the user. A lot of wasted data space and waste of time. I am requesting a return to the original Kindle OS.",0,0
"This thing is awesome, I had a firestick and then I upgraded to the FireTV and it is much faster and much smoother. It is a 2015 model and I am not sure if it will be upgraded in the near future but it is pretty decent in 2017. Also much easier and user friendly than the Apple TV also cheaper,",2,2
"Alexa can answer most questions, play music from your library, and even order items you have run out of. This ""toy"" is a lot of fun! I recommend it - I haven't had it very long but so far so good - thumbs up for Alexa!",2,2
Great tablet. Phenomenal value for the money. I've bought one for everyone in my family.,2,2
Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.,2,2
It's exactly what it says it is. Really happy with it.,2,2
A very handy device to have with you when you're on a budget and an active Amazon member. Works wonders as a Prime Member!,2,2
Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable,2,2
Got this Amazon Echo because it was half off the regular price. It was a fun surprise gift for my family.,2,2
Throw it in the backseat for long car rides and you're golden,2,2
Works Great. My 3rd Kindle. Only complaint...they break,2,2
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.",2,2
Finally I can read at the beach and it's super light!,2,2
"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",2,2
I bought this Kindle for myself last year and it's the best $50 I've spent! I hoped that my sister would enjoy one.,2,2
The Kindle fire was a xmas present for my son in law and he just loves it.,2,2
I bought this for my son for Christmas and its perfect. My son gets to play his games with easy access to Amazon prime content.,2,2
I Love It Works Great.Tried To Purchase This Kindle Fire At Christmas Time It Was Sold Out. But I Keep Going Back To Best Buy And Finally They Were In Stock So I Bought One And Now I'm Happy......,2,2
Very nice screen resolution. Easy to read in both sun and in the dark.,2,2
I love the picture quality from this device. Can't go wrong with a 4k . Also the picture steaming on the TV screen amazing. Good job amazon.,2,2
My daughter is 6 and she plays with everyday and my son had one last year good quality,2,2
"You can download free apps, take good pics and the resolution looks great!",2,2
Bought it as a present for my wife. She is very pleased with her reader.,2,2
"Alexa is great , is a great house hold tool around the house , timers alarm , sleep machine everything u need",2,2
Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,0,2
Started with fire sticks as I thought cheaper was better option then I got to see one of these in action. So much faster.. definitely would recommend.,2,2
Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.,2,2
"This is my first piece of streaming equipment, and it was simple to set up and use. The remote control is convenient, and it has voice control. This apparatus makes streaming movies from Amazon Prime super easy.",2,2
"I picked up the Fire TV because I already owned 3 Fire Sticks and was happy with them. I wanted a unit that I was familiar with and I""m glad I bought this one. I don't really use Alexa so that didn't play a part in the purchase. However, you really see the dual core processing power when you start apps. It's a good bit faster than the Fire Sticks with the same ease of use. As an added bonus, you can install and play games. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",2,2
"I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch",2,2
First Ereader ever bought and it has been one of the best purchases ever. Have had no problems with it and it genuinely feel like you're reading a paperback book. 10 out of 10 would recommend,2,2
"We purchased a couple Amazon Firesticks first to facilitate cutting the cord. The Firesticks are ok for bedrooms or less used TVs, they just don't perform as well as the more powerful Amazon TV Box. I will be purchasing another one for the movie room. It's been great cutting the cord. But the one thing I'm waiting in is for Hulu Live to make it over to the Amazon platform. They keep saying soon, so patiently waiting. Hulu Live looks to be much better than our current Sling service. Other than that the box is great and that one issue might be Hulu or networks holding it up.",2,1
"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too.",2,2
"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps.",2,2
works good,2,2
This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable,2,2
Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.,2,2
This item is great if you have prime. I really enjoy it. I even bought my parents one. If you don't have prime. Get the Google home.,2,2
I bought this to use with a particular app but wasn't able to install them so I returned the tablets.,0,2
Never thought this would be as useful as it is. Just ask Alexa to play a song and it will.,2,2
"I use Amazon Echo for the weather, timer, music, news, and am learning more and more uses for her. I am happy with this product.",2,2
I love my Echo! it is easy to use and I also use it to turn on the lights in my house. I works great!,2,2
My son really likes the larger screen to play games.,2,2
I am enjoying using the new and growing features of Alexa. I wish that it wouldn't suddenly turn on for no reason (even in a quiet room). It seems like it's monitoring me. Uncomfortable.,2,2
Not sure about having a bot monitor my household. 1984 has come to fruition.,2,2
"What made this even better was the Black Friday prices on the Kindle Fires. At $35.00, if they get broken, it's not as big of a deal. I remember buying one of these when they came out and it was a whole lot more than it is now. That's technology for you, I guess. Great buy. Great product.",2,2
Is exactly what I was hoping for. Easy to use. Absolutely perfect product.,2,2
I am using Alexa for my thermostats. It feels so good I can change my thermostats while I am in bed. I'll continue to use Alexa for other things. With my voice I can do anything with Alexa.,2,2
Great clarity for a tablet of this price point. Amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf. The only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking pictures in poor light. However given the dollar per value you can't beat it. Attractive looks good fit and finish makes it stand out in a sea of choices!,2,2
Amazon Fire TV Brings pretty much every streaming app all under one easy-to-use interface.,2,2
Works whenever I want...learns my speech patterns and I can use it listen to music whenever I want,2,2
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.,2,2
"Its a little expensive but is a good Product, I will recommend this one over the Amazon TV stick",2,2
"I cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick, and liking it. It's a great product, and with my amazon prime membership, gives us lots of viewing options, especially for the kids who don't mind not seeing the latest episode of their shows (we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service, which is available on the fire tv). The kids also enjoy all the games on it. The only issue is that many of the games that the kids want to play require a separate controller, which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one.",2,2
I now have access to music in my bedroom. I love it!,2,2
"Great tablet for simple reading, web surfing without too many features",2,2
My few family members bought at least one or two as gift. All the kids seem to enjoy,2,2
Fire box is the way to go. Speed rules and this is in the top of the class.,2,2
"My grandchildren love this. Its the perfit size for them and ot allows them to do all the things they want. The price was also great, much less than a large tablet.",1,2
The fire tv box streams really well and might just be better than my Roku 3.,2,2
kid proof! bought for my grand babies and they love it!,2,2
"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",2,2
Purchased before going on vacation. Good price and compact design. Works great better than paperbacks,2,2
love my kindle it's awesome read on it in the dark all the time,2,2
Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.,2,2
"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,",1,2
This is a great product. Easy to use and very user friendly.,2,2
"This is helpful if you read for more than 30 minutes. I have personally noticed that after 6hr reading, I have no headache or strain in my eyes.Also battery life is unlimited. Charge it once for a couple of hours and your are good to go for 2 weeks of extensive reading.",2,2
I haven't finished setting this up. But the demo section explains how to setup. Alexa seems ready to follow the commands.,2,2
"I had the original kindle fire from many years ago that survived many a drop onto concrete floor without sustaining any damage, so I hope this one will last as long. Easy to start up and charges fast. Already had a couple of os updates that were very fast downloading and installing. No problems.",2,1
"The product works fine, but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to its full potential.",1,2
"We now own 4 Kindle Fires, they keep getting better. Very pleased",2,2
Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.,2,2
Amazon kindle is a very good to keep yourself busy with a good book.,2,2
Very nice size. Now only 50$. There's no Google play store so can't use Google Chrome cast to watch movies on tv. A tablet Without a Google play store is a disadvantage.,0,2
"When I made this purchase, it was for what I thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music. I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!",2,2
Alexa works great with music. Just wish you didn't need premium spotty to use it on alexa.,2,2
A friend recommended this. And I am loving how easy it was to use.,2,2
"Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less.",2,2
"Excellent tablet I have used , I will recommend to my friends.",2,2
The fire tv outperforms the Apple TV I have already installed on my tv. Great 4K playback and great selection of apps.,2,2
Works good for a cheap tablet to have around work and not worry about. Freezes occasionally but not a big deal for the cost.,2,2
"I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet.",2,2
I have 2 other tablets that I use. It doesn't work well as a tablet. I bought to use as a kindle. It works great as a cheaper kindle.,2,2
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it! Long battery life, small and convenient to carry and great book selection.",2,2
I bought this kindle before travelingin Asia for 6 weeks. I didn't want to bring any expensive electronics I case anything happened. This tablet did everything I hoped and more. It was perfect for reading and keeping in touch with people back home.,2,2
This case is great. It feels very secure around my tablet. I'm much more confident carrying my Fire around. Love the fact that it stands either portrait or landscape.,2,2
Fixed problem after several power bumps/outages even with surge protector. Happy spending cost for new power adaptor vs. new Echo,2,2
Super fast streaming TV. Great content. Endless entertainment,2,2
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...,2,2
"I still haven't used the camera, once I figure it out I will use it. I love the features on it. I use it for facebook mostly & emails. I also play some of the games on facebook.",2,2
It was a great kindle fire! It functions well as a reading device and a tablet. Plays good audio books.,2,2
"Quality and packaging is nice.It's a Kindle USB charger, it works what more can I say.I also charge my Bluetooth earphones with this.",2,2
"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations.",1,0
"I gave the Amazon Echo as a gift. My friend is ""setup challenged"", so I was expecting a call to head over to get it going. Instead, I received a call telling me how much she LOVED it!",2,2
"Have not yet received it yet, but I am sure it will be great, as I was assure if was what I would need to go with my Kindle Voyage Reader to recharge it. I am anxiously awaiting for the arrival of my reader so I can start getting books to read. Sincerely, JudieMae",2,2
Bought this for my daughter and she didn't care for it when it came to the apps. Works great for reading.,0,2
I love my Echo and the ease in using it. I may buy another one.,2,2
Sometimes the screen is not as responsive as I would like it to be but it does what we need it to do and our daughter loves it.,2,2
"If you have amazon prime membership, I would suggest this device, also not, the remote has access to alexa, so there is more possibilities for using it with smart home devices",2,2
I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break,2,2
I bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. She loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. It is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.,2,2
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.,2,2
Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!,2,2
"I never thought I would ever purchase a Kindle device for reading books, but now that I have one, I wish I would have done this a long time ago. I enjoy being able to read anywhere. Plus being able to purchase a book anytime I want is such a nice feature.",2,2
"Perfect for the bathroom, we love it! We have about 6 Alexa's in the house now and planning on sticking with this AI.",2,2
Like it better than the keyboard one. No need for a case with light the brightness adjusts which makes it nice.,2,2
"Since it is called powerfast, I thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all. It worked but it took about 5 hours to charge an almost empty Kindle Fire HD 8 inch tablet.",1,0
It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.,2,2
"We are using Alexa for many daily chores, music, weather, radio etc.",2,2
a lot less buffering than the fire stick. this is almost as quick as my Nvidia shield. wish i could download android apps,2,2
Was very pleased with this product. Glad it worked out and provides flexibility for use.,2,2
Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.,2,2
"The Kindle Paperwhite was well worth the upgrade from my previous Kindle E-Reader. The touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever I like. These features use up battery a bit faster than the basic model, but recharging more frequently is not so bad considering the conveniences gained. I noticed one bothersome quirk, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes it jumps ahead more than one page when I touch to turn. Checking online, I see that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. If it continues or becomes more bothersome, I will contact Amazon customer service for a solution.",2,2
"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.",1,2
Gave this tablet to my son's girlfriend for Christmas . She loves it!,2,2
"I have a total of 6 firetv box at my house, most of the time, cable has nothing serious to watch, but with firetv, you will find something for sure to watch.....",2,2
Very easy to set up and easy to use for grandkids. Love the ease of use and the amount of information the Echo can be used for,2,2
I bought 2 of these for my 5-year-old nieces for Christmas. They both travel frequently and the Fire provides hours of entertainment. There is a ton of child-appropriate content available to download. The Fire is a great alternative to a pricier tablet.,2,2
"Bought this to replace my older Kindle Fire 6, got a 64GB MicroSD card for it and no problem. Only issues I'm having is in apps but its due to the app. The colour and sound on this kindle is just great and I love the bigger screen and the fact I can add extra memory to it in order to allow more to remain on it for a longer time.",2,2
she says it gives her what she wants and love it very much.,2,2
I think everyone knows by now that this is a must have item. If you find it on sale and don't already have one then you should probably buy it. It's a great product.,2,2
"Amazon Fire TV is worth the cost for me , I watch a lot of shows.The game controller and games, not so much. They remind me of the old style joy stick games...sorry I bought that part., its hard to use.",2,2
"I purchased 2 as xmas gifts for kids. Perfect size and I could set up child accounts under my existing Amazon account. Win, win!",2,2
"Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it's pretty indestructible.",2,2
"Fun product. Especially handy for putting entire music collection in one place with Super easy access via verbal commands. Also handy for hands free notation such as setting timer while cooking or jotting down shopping list. ""Alexa- set timer for 5 minutes and add garlic to shopping list""",2,2
"It has an excellent collection of apps, interface is really smooth and no hick ups.",2,2
"So far I'm enjoying it but I do miss my wireless headset receiver on the Roku 3 remote remote.I switched because im able to put Kodi on the Fire TV, you cannot on Roku 3",2,2
Nice product but does not always respond to voice commands which have to be repeated.,2,2
I am pleased that my 6 year old grandson was happy with his gift,2,2
"Great quality, over priced apple tablets! Fire has domain! Simplicity! Overall easy to navigate!",2,2
"The Fire Tablet is not only affordable, but a great piece of technology for choldren. The selection of books and games are very good.",2,2
I got this for my wife. She loves it. Very user friendly. Forever battery life.,2,2
Very convenient enjoy having Alexa around the house,2,2
Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.,2,2
It's a bit pricey but that is not Best Buy's fault since Amazon controls that. It's convenient for traveling (especially at night since it has the built-in light feature) and it's very small and light to carry around.,2,2
Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.,2,2
"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution",2,2
Like to ask questions to Alexa without have to move from my chair. Really like the skills that relate to what I like and what I need.,2,2
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores.",2,2
If your looking for a simple tablet that does basic things? This is the one for you. I like it.,1,2
"easy to use, best value for the price, and i would recommend this product to everybody",2,2
Great way to increase your music library without buying cds,2,2
"Works well my little loves it,battery life great..",2,2
My kids adore their tablets! Best purchase ever!!!,2,2
"I was somewhat skeptical about getting this tablet, and especially for that low of a price. But no later than 1 week I went back and purchased another one for my wife. This Amazon Kindle Fire is awesome.",2,2
My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.,2,2
No complaints from a functional tablet that does all you need for a great price!,2,2
Cool. A lot of movies and tv I wouldn't get otherwise,2,2
Alexa is very much fun and informative. Definitely a must for the modern life,2,2
both adults and children will be delighted with this tablet.,2,2
Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .,2,2
"Found screen display, easy use and very versatile just the right size",2,2
"This tablet is great for the kids, however if going out of country might not work didn't for me overall the kids enjoy 5",2,2
Good item..quality color and visual..Would buy another,2,2
I was tired of trying to read my books on my regular kindle fire or my phone and NEVER being able to do so because the screen was too dark or glare was to strong.This is my 3rd kindle and I love it the best! perfect indoors or outdoors. Small and compact. Fits easily in my purse or tote.,2,2
Very pleased with Fire TV. It works as described. Excellent item,2,2
"Echo is great fun particularly if you have connected devices like Wemo or Lifx bulbs or Next thermostat. At first you think you may not use that much, then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat, like when you are cooking and your hands are messy. I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with. Lifx bulbs have direct integration, but you can't change the colors without IFTT I think, and Nest thermostat has direct integration. Looking to the future for more direct integration of things.",2,2
"This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time.",2,2
Great price and great for young one and a good tablets for beginners,2,2
"I've was married to the same man for 30 something yrs and they was the best time in my life we have kids that's all grown and they have kids now. I love them deeply but they all are upset with me because they haven't had a Christmas ,I always get my Grand kids something but it hasn't happen in 3 yrs. I can't seem to be able to afford it any more I thought the kids would love the tablet I know they will because they all stay on computer like me it's educational for them and my self. I'm disable and have nothing to do so",2,2
My mom love this tablet. The graphics is cool and neat and my mom can see everything.,2,2
I got this tablet for my son works good enough for his age. I recommend this tab for kids,1,2
I really have enjoyed using my Kindle on airplanes. I can read without turning the overhead light on.,2,2
bought this one for my son in law. He was using his phone for internet. Now he is able to get on the internet a lot easier.,2,2
It seems Alexa doesn't really do anything for free. Haha. You have to subscribe to just about everything. I tried it for a couple of days and returned it.,2,2
I like that you can access thousands of movies or tv shows. Just make sure you have enough speed on your router.,2,2
The Amazon Echo is lots of fun to use. It is so smart! Easy to set up.,2,2
Seamless transition from old device. Easy to use. Completely happy.,2,2
If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!,2,2
It has been nice having the echo love it bought dot for g daughter,2,2
"this is the best e-reader, great quality, great price.",2,2
"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials.",2,2
"This is actually my second one. If you are between this or the echo dot -buy this unless you need the smaller size of the dot. The dot speaker is very poor, but you can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. But the speaker in this one is super!! Sounds as good as my Bose speaker",2,2
My husband prefers the Paperwhite model over the Voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers. And Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models are much easier to read for long hours than tablets (easier on the eyes). I have an iPad and still have a Kindle for reading. I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models.,2,2
"Solid product, great speaker, but another device to help you consume media and spend money. Alexa order me stuff!",2,2
I like the tablet. We got it for my nephew who is 5. He can easily use it daily. He has a lot of educational games downloaded and it stays charged for awhile.,2,2
"I bought this thing thinking it's a cool little gadget. But I have to admit, she has the ability to do a lot of things. It's like Siri on steroids! With the appropriate items, she's able to turn on/off lights, order things through Amazon and they just announced that she will soon be able to interact with the bmw i3! The kids especially love it, they just wish she can do their homework!",2,2
I'm very accustomed to using verbal commands with my Samsung Galaxy... Same experience,2,2
I love my FireStick but the addition of 4K streaming is worth getting the FireTV. It seems to be noticeably faster as well.,2,2
Best Tablet under $50. It works great with a perfect size to hold in hand. Great deal.,2,2
This is my first kindle paperwhite.Great battery life and Best E-paper tablet.,2,2
"This is the best streaming device in the market. Fast & easy setup. Allows u2 program it and hookup peripheral devices such as mouse, keyboard.Firestick is only 2.4Ghz, so make sure to get the box. It also has ability to stream via hardwire.",2,2
Very comfortable to read from - doesn't give off a bright light if reading at light. Doesn't strain eyes,2,2
Both of my kids purchased one of these and love them. They are inexpensive and so far durable.,2,2
"It's a great little gadget , but I'm a little bit disappointed she doesn't understand my accent to well .",2,2
My three yr. Old is loving his tablet. He likes to see the free games and I can monitor very early every time he logs in. Great product for the fam.,2,2
Great product for our needs and great value! Bought one for my son and a second for my mom.,2,2
I have two of these and four Fire Sticks. They are great for accessing Amazon content and any of your other favorite streaming apps/games. With a moderate Internet speed there is virtually no delay for programming to start. Alexa remote is handy so you can quickly search.,2,2
It works well for what I am using it for. To access shows.,2,2
Great table for kids. Easy to use. Good Parental control.,2,2
"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.",0,0
This is a great movie box. Subscribe to Amazon and you'll have access to tons of content. Games are cool addition also.,2,2
I bought this for my daughter and it was worth it. Everything works well. Camera is good. My daughter watches her shows without problems.,2,2
sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable,2,2
Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it!,2,2
The best e-reader to use and handle. This is my 2nd one and will get another one in the future. Recommend this e-reader,2,2
"Really impressed with this little device. It has all the. Ells and whistles including 4K UHD streaming in Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon Video. However, it does not stream in HDR ( not a deal breaker for me). Love this device.",2,2
I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.,2,2
8/18/16Love the product & price.Would recommend.Customer.,2,2
"Very goodWas undecided between new PaperWhite and Voyage models and doing a lot of research to see which one is best. Based on some personal analysis on in-store samples, I felt the Voyage has nothing more price worthy than what new PW could offer with lesser $$$. If you are undecided like me, don't worry about the gimmicks of voyage, go for PW..",2,2
It is very easy to operate and comes in handy for news weather and good way to keep up with your calendar.,2,2
I bought two of it. I love the way the battery last for a long time.,2,2
"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet.",0,2
"It works and streams very good, like the memory and it's still portable",2,2
"It's fantastic! All my photo albums, movie purchases, Amazon prime movies in one place.",2,2
Will play your cloud based music or I Heart Radio station with excellent sound. I have also used it to check the weather everyday and my wife uses it for a timer when cooking. I also like it being linked to my calendar and just asking what is on the calendar today and it will tell me.,2,2
"It is better than in thought it was. At first I didnt like how small the screen was, but then the conistent reading, it got much better. After a month i it grew on me.",2,1
It was better than I thought it would be. We use it everyday!,2,2
Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.,2,2
Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!,2,2
This product works just as well as the higher-priced ones from the cell phone company.,2,2
I purchased this for my son and its the best thing I bought.,2,2
This is a great tablet and I love using it.it is simple to use and I'm happy that I purchased it.,2,2
I bought this for my daughter who has Down's Syndrome. It was an inexpensive first time tablet for her. She absolutely loves it and is always watching her shows and videos. It is easy for her to navigate and understand.,2,2
I got a Fire Stick and have noticed that it was a mistake in not having waited for the Amazon Fire T.V. instead. The performance in this Fire T.V. is great. Performs faster and easier than its 1st (Fire Stick). Glad I got it.,2,2
"BYE BYE CABLE TV, KODI ON THE FIRE TV TAKES OVER..YES SIR",2,0
I am happy with this product thus far. I like the size and the screen quality is just okay. I am use to the iPad quality of screen.,2,2
Very good deal!! Quality top with very good price!!!,2,2
Upon purchasing this I couldn't imagine what I was missing. It has been a great upgrade to my home. It has really brought my home closer to the new age,2,2
Alexa is handy but doesn't always work. We have two lights outside and sometimes both with turn on or off when commanded and sometimes only one will turn on or off.,1,2
This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.,2,2
Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.,2,2
"I just love the Amazon Echo. It does so many things that I've almost started to take them for granted. From the time I get up in the morning or when I get home from work Alexis is ready. First thing in the morning I ask about the weather and a synopsis of the news. I have her play music while I'm getting ready for work. I can set a timer if I'm cooking or to remind me it's time to leave. If a question pops into my head I can ask Alexis. If I want to know what's on my calendar for the day, I ask Alexis. Where have you been all my life?",2,2
It's great deal for a person who's working at nite. Thanks,2,2
"Love the ease and convenience of Amazon Echo......there are so many things that ""she"" can do with just a ""voice command"". Our favorite is turning on the lights, controlling the NEST, and playing music!!",2,2
this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!,2,2
"Alexa has come in handy by giving calculations while cooking, weather reports, and even settling arguments about trivia facts. Very nice!",2,2
"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password.",2,2
"Bought this as a present for my boyfriend, and we both were very disappointed. I read lots of reviews and thought it would be an awesome gift to give. Alexa is a Siri downgrade. Don't waste your money on this.",0,2
I recommend this to everyone! Love having all my videos in one spot and easy to use! Plus parental controls to stop purchases and restrict shows!,2,2
I had previously purchased one for our family and when they went on sale I purchased one for my daughter. Everyday I find something new to use it for.,2,2
Have it located in our kitchen and is great for listening to your Amazon music. Voice recognition is good and we also use the timer function often. The quality of the sound is good too with decent bass.,2,2
I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all,1,2
" I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it.",2,2
"This has been one of the best ""set-top box"" replacement experiences ever. I love that it combines all available online video contents in one. Great interface and very stable too!",2,2
The tablet is good. It is a little slow but I'm not sure if it's my wifi or the tablet. I like that you can add a memory card :),2,2
Great charger,2,2
"This is the best cord cutter streaming box on the market. I've owned Roku, Apple TV, and Chromecast and this is by far the best. Offers great performance, the remote is very user friendly and I think it has a better selection of apps. The interface is laid out nicely but feels a little compact with a lot of stuff on the screen all at once.",2,2
headphone port did not work at first but after a hard reset the worked,2,0
"Bought this for my mother for Christmas. I wanted something small enough for her to handle and reliable. Decided a Fire tablet fit the bill. And, Best Buy had plenty in stock!",2,2
"Alexa is very entertaining and provides a plethora of information at the sound of your voice. I must say, however that SIRI is more personable. I hope Alexa loosens up as time goes on.",2,2
This tablet is nice for the price. Recommended for kids or an adult who doesn't need a large screen.,2,2
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.,2,2
"Easy to use, fantastic product plethora of movies, games, and always new content being added",2,2
"Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on.",2,2
"Fun,sometimes difficult in phrasing my question fr Alexa. I love it but still having difficulty finding the ap to enable different things. N love the music and sound is good.",2,2
"easy to use, easy to love. extremely user friendly. Beats the nook I had by a 1000%. the battery life is outstanding",2,2
"Every time I ask Alexa for something, my 2 year old grandson runs over and tries to pronounce her name, he's almost there, hopefully he'll have a question for her as well. He likes dancing to the nursery rhymes that I ask her to play for him.",2,2
This is a great product! Our family loves the convenience of asking questions on the go!,2,2
"We purchased the tablet for our mom's 63rd birthday and she loves it!!! She had absolutely no problems when it came to the initial setup. Our mom has been reading books, listening to music, ordering items through the mail and watching videos like a pro. We couldn't have gotten her a better gift!!!",2,2
Purchased this on Black Friday as a gift for my 9 year old. Set up was super easy. I like how I can create multiple profiles on the device so that my son only has access to what I want him to have access to.,2,2
"I was in best buy having computer worked on, waiting I saw the Amazon fire 6, and saw the great price and bought it. I have been pleased with the features and user friendly.",1,2
"The Echo is a very good addition to our home. Very easy to use, setup was a bit of challenge to get to my WiFi, but once I understood (I am 64), what it was trying to do, it went smooth and easy. We have had a few really good laughs as we put it through some paces, but really glad we made the purchase",2,2
"My wife loves the fact that it feels like a book to her. From the weight of the reader to the brightness of the screen, it reminds her of reading a paper book. My wife is happy with the product so I gave it a 5.",2,2
Good price for the tablet. I brought this for my nephew,2,2
We bought two of these for our kids and they both love them! Easy to set up and operate. They are a welcome improvement over them using their phones for all the apps and games they enjoy.,2,2
I purchased two tablets for Christmas gifts and they were great!,2,2
great buy. excellent product. Just need to buy a cover to protect,2,2
"okay for a toy, does not work well for some of us, with different noise environment, and different accent. Some times the searched results are funny. Also, hope it support other languages. Price too high also.",2,2
"I needed a gift for my nephew who was graduating from college and who seems to have everything. Decided on the Echo since I've been wanting one and thought he probably didn't have it. I was happy when he seemed excited about receiving it, but thrilled when he kept texting me the following week to tell me how great it was and all the things he had Alexa doing for him! I'm now even more convinced that I need one for myself, especially since I am moving toward making my house a ""smart"" home.",2,2
"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",2,0
"After reading the reviews, it's an awesome gadget added to the collection!",2,2
Very easy to setup with app. You can get plenty of information and facts. I setup with pandora to play my favorite selections. I bought wemo wifi outlets but not setup yet with echo. Sound of speaker is fabulous. I also bought the dot for the bedrooms.,2,2
"According to my girlfriend, it is slow, but functional for simple things like web and watching TV. I bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied. Seems like an very good piece of hardware for only $50. Suspect amazon keeps the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you content through their locked-down store. It is an android tablet, but most of the google software you're used to is not there, which is the biggest downfall.",2,0
"Bought the Kindle Voyage and it had a yellow tint on the top half. Found out later this is a defect on most. Also, the auto light part I didn't like. Much happier with this, and it's cheaper.",2,0
This is so much faster than my old blueray player loading apps and streaming. Works great and so many options!!,2,2
Awesome tablet for kids pre loaded with a ton of things and the case is even better,2,2
Purchased the Kindle PaperWhite because I got tired of reading on regular tablets and ipads. Those devices really do strain your eyes...not so with the Kindle. The display is crisp and amazing. The battery life is astronomical. Highly recommended and for the price...it is a steal.,2,2
This is a fully functional tablet allowing you to read with comfort and in full sun. I thoroughly enjoy it.,2,2
Just love it. Would not leave home with out it. Recommend to any read aholic.,2,2
I love this box. It's the best thing out there. I cut my cable completely off. Great savings.,2,2
I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon,0,0
bought this as a gift for my daughter who is very ill and has to be confined to indoors mostly and she loves it,2,2
Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.,2,1
I like the product work vey well and I am very happy with it.,2,2
For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal,2,2
"Bought this as a gift for my family, mainly to play music from Amazon. Very pleased with how easy it is to set up and use.",2,2
"It has many uses. You can listen to music, check the weather, listen to podcasts and music. You can also use it as an alarm.",2,2
I bought 3 for my grandchildren and they love their tablets,2,2
"The possibilities are endless with the Amazon Echo. I'm just getting started with the Echo, but I know that I'll be using this for a long time.",2,2
My grandson loves his tablet. He recently lost his (we are not sure where) and was so happy to see the new one,2,2
I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products,2,2
What more needs to be said. The best low price tablet out there. This is our 2nd one and it is easier to use. Our I Pad Air has more features but cost considerably more.,2,2
This fire TV is really awesome for viewing content the Amazon video is really great and has lots of content,2,2
Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker.,2,2
This is hands down the best media streaming device available today. If you have a 4k tv the box enhances the resolution any other tv the sticks will work fine.,2,2
"I have both the fire stick and box but, the box is my favorite by far!",2,2
Somewhat awkward to setup in Canada but once done it is an amazing source of useful features. Enjoy the link to my Spotify subscription and some of the new apps that are created for the Echo. It even has a sense of humour and sharp answers to stupid questions. Well worth the price.,2,2
This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage,2,2
Wow - for 49.99? You gotta be kidding me. What a great buy for the money!,2,2
"Alexa is great. She plays music for me, tells me the news, tells me jokes, reminds me to get to my appointments. She sometimes misinterprets my requests. She's not perfect. She helps me with yoga.",2,2
Now I have fire tv in all my room is. A great product you can do a lot of thing,2,2
Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.,2,2
Perfect size and readability and function for pages turning is comfortable,2,2
Unit has fast response time. Graphics are very clear.,2,2
Great its the box that will save me money. A must buy,2,2
"Lots of fun, but also very useful. Have it connected to my Nest Thermostat and going to connect it to my Caséta Wireless switches. The speaker has great bass for its size. Search YouTube videos for tips and tricks. It does more then you think,",2,2
"Expensive speaker. Voice recognition does not work so well. Skill set is extemely limited even though Amazon claims 10,000.",0,2
Great price. Useful and what I was looking for. Couldn't get the updated version yet but loved how this one operates and looks.,2,2
I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???,0,2
Bought for grandkids for Christmas and they love them!!,2,2
I absolutely positively Love my Kindle Fire! It is the best of both worlds being a Kindle & a Inexspensive Tablet!,2,2
"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. Also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. My other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. I will not be replacing his with this product.",0,0
This Kindle makes for a great beginner tablet for a teenager. The only complaint is that it is a little laggy but great for the price.,2,2
ok tablet - can do what I need - doesn't stay charged long enough tho,2,2
"so far it's a nice toy in the kitchen, and it appears that there is a lot of up and coming apps that will be nice once they are all working. right now it can only do basic stuff. the speaker on it is just ok, they could improve that on the next upgrade. i don't even think it's stereo.",1,2
I learn more and more every day what this product can do,2,2
"The 7"" screen is just right for size. Comes w/ plenty of extra goodies from Amazon and Audible, among others. The only complaint is the display in bright, direct sunlight requires adjustment to full bright, or I'd have given it 5 stars.",2,2
I originally bought this solely for the BOINGO app. However it has a large selection of apps and I now use it everyday.,2,2
This is my second tablet that I have purchased. This one was a gift for other son. He loves it & I recommended it to numerous friends.,2,2
I think this tablet is very easy to use. It is price well.,2,2
Great for all round entertainment. I connected it to my Amazon account and even my phone so o could view my pictures on the TV. I unfortunately had to return it because one of the purposes for which I bought it was not fulfiled.,2,2
exactly what he wanted and he is very happy with it. no problems,2,2
I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.,2,2
So far we like. Wish I could control tv. It's lil expensive but seems to work great. Decent speakers as well.,2,2
"Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed.",2,2
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.,2,2
The best bang for the buck in streaming tv. Buy 1 for each tv,2,2
I bought this tablet for my dad who is not tech savvy what so ever. Great tablet for a beginner.,2,2
"I went back and forth about what kind of tablet to purchase for my child. I am very impressed with the ability for things to be simple for her to navigate as well as being able to place perimeters on how long she can use the apps, Internet, and watch videos as well as how much reading time she has to have.",2,2
"Wanted to buy the Amazon echo for a long time, was glad that I saw the offer best buy had, got it around 2 weeks ago and I love it so far, for me listening to music is a big part of my day and the sound on the echo is fantastic, I really like the design, Alexa is pretty helpful even though I haven't had the chance yet to fully use her capabilities but asking for a song or ordering things from Amazon is pretty easy and convenient, I have an accent and Alexa doesnt have any problems understanding me!, would definitely recommend it.",2,2
Purchased for a child. Works great Very pleased. Very versatile,2,2
I bought this during Black Friday sales the price was very attractive but I didn't find it that attractive as YouTube stream was streaming slow it was taking 10-15 min to stream a single song.,0,2
Bought this tablet for my husband for Christmas and it is great. Easy to use and just what he was wanting.,2,2
Excellant starter tablet . I love that it is preset with children in mind. I love the color choices available since I have 5 grandchildren who each got this product for Christmas,2,2
"I originally bought the tablet because I enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles. Not having time to do them at home, I found apps that I could use on the cell phone while on the train. But, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. I've found that I can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the Kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time I can spend on them, that's good enough for me.But, the Kindle offers so much more. There are other great games and puzzle apps from the APP Store plus there's a six-month ""free"" trial subscription to the WASHINGTON POST. You can go online via WiFi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the Internet, just like on a regular computer.It's great fun!",2,2
Excellent echo radio....good invented....nice product..,2,2
"i can't ask for this tablet to more than what its supposed, good starter for kids before they get an iPad :)",2,2
I was concerned that I was wasting my money because I already have an iPad. I was WRONG! I LOVE IT!,2,2
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.,2,2
Crazy price for tablet. Was a great christmas gift.,2,2
"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!",2,2
I love this! Easy to set up and easy to use. Would recommend it for sure.,2,2
I gave the echo to two of my friends. They were impressed with Alexa and her instant answers to any questions that were asked. They also liked the instant access to music from Amazon Prime,2,2
i would recommend this to others. i think it is great for someone who is just getting into electronics.,2,2
Perfect item for my grand-kids and the price was especially just what I needed.,2,2
I liked this so much I got one for my dad and step mom along with the smart plug in outlet so they can turn on their lights!!!,2,2
"Alexa is great when asking about the weather, or when wanting to play some music quickly. However, majority of the questions I ask it cannot find. I think that the questions are pretty simple too. She will answer questions with direct answers like ""whats 2+2"" but if you go much further she wont respond.",1,2
This is our second box for our bedroom. We got our first over a year ago when we decided we were't paying a $200 cable bill each month. We have no complaints at all.,2,2
"I bought the amazon stick as a bday gift for my cousin. It's pretty easy to use, with its plug and play features",2,2
Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts,2,2
These things are great if you don't want to pay high cable bills and have a prime account.,2,2
Not that I don't love it but I wish it would have been a little bigger. More book like.,2,2
It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.,1,2
This is an item I use EVERY day! I bought one for my mother in law who is paralyzed and she loves it!,2,2
"It's small I can take it with me where ever I go. I can read, play games, and get on the Internet. Not to mention the price was right.",2,2
"I have a 1st generation and 2 of the second generation FireTV devices. I've been very happy with them. What I didn't expect was my Samsung remote to work with the Amazon unit since the Amazon remote is not an IR remote, but the Samsung remote works great. Very happy with the responsiveness of the FireTV unit. Menus seem very intuitive.",2,2
I love the product and its easy to use would love to recommend it to friends,2,2
This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.,2,2
We purchased this tablet for my 6 year old daughter to replace her RCA tablet that lasted a year. It is fabulous. I'm considering getting myself one for those long drives when your lap top is too big!,2,2
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.,2,2
Works great. Love the size and light weight. Love it!,2,2
Great product would highly recomend this. Sales person was really help full,2,2
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,",2,2
It's more for people that want to read without glare,0,2
bought this as an upgrade for my 9 yr old son from his Nabi and he loves it,2,2
"This product does far more than we expecxted. We use it fore the news, weather and music",2,2
Very nice....some of the apps were hard to open at first...but had to play around with....love it now! Would definitely buy more again.,2,2
huge visual improvement for my on the go use. works just fine.,2,2
"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet.",2,2
"I got this for my 88 year old mother to view pics on Facebook of her children,grandchildren,great grandchildren and great great grandchildren. With the kids protection bumper she is able to handle it well. The bad side is that I wanted to hide all the other apps and could not. Plus I ended up paying an extra $15 to get rid of ads.",1,2
"Really good buy, has dual camera, games really good",2,2
"Very happy with device ,,, may purchase second device",2,2
I love my Fire. I can do so much with it plus read my books and be online also,2,2
I just would like to say I brought this tablet for my 11 year old. And she has had it in her hand ever since. Great buy,2,2
All of the sales people were very helpful with selecting the proper product,2,2
"Gave this to my dad for his birthday. He loves it. Can play music, keep lists, set timers, and set up my buddy which is awesome. And it only gets better.",2,2
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.,2,2
Awesome for 4 year olds. Tons of security features and very easy to use.,2,2
"Very happy with the Fire TV works great with all my streaming apps Netflix, Hulu and Amazon's own video app... Best of all works great with PlayStation Vue just works flawless from the interface to many different options it offers... All around a great device from being reliable, quick boot-up, to no lagging and no buffering... Totally recommend especially for Amazon Prime members...",2,2
not as good as the first kindle fire I got and ok product.,1,2
"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it.",2,2
Loved this kindle! Bought it for my siblings. They loved it too and it was cheap for me!,2,2
"Great device. Very fast and responsive. Capable of streaming in 4k and while there is limited content, it comes thru beautifully. Alexa and voice search is fantastic.",2,2
"While I find myself limited at the moment to playing music and adding to my grocery list, I look forward to expanding my connected home. For what I use it for, it is fantastic. It even works great with answering questions the kids have and responding quickly to needs. It understands fairly well and it hears me throughout the house.",2,2
"This is a great upgrade, with the touch screen but still with the perfect ability to read outside!Set up is idiot proof and very quick. I like that you can have two accounts on it now, as my husband uses it also. Has a very long battery life and is pretty rugged as I dropped a couple of times.If you love to read outside this is the product for you!",2,2
"This has to be one of the best deals around - The screen resolution is good, the speed is adequate and it is versatile as a reader, game device or internet tablet.",2,2
"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",1,2
thanks,2,2
"I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift.",2,2
"The sound is amazing,will do many things like your shopping list,tell jokes and many other things...",2,2
Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.,2,2
"Awesome video streaming device. Great picture quality, easy hook up. Out of everything this media device offers I must say the sound quality gets 5 stars. If you have this device connected to your surround sound you will not be disappointed at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't connect my hard drive to watch my home family video's the USB slot does not recognized my home movies on my hard drive or thumb drive.",2,2
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well,2,2
Easy to set up. Has great sound. Nice to talk too.,2,2
Great for listening to music. Real nice sound. My 7 year old loves being able to control Alexia.,2,2
"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son.",2,0
"Best device ever, don't' use my Bose radio any more",2,2
Great product! Amazon prime music is at my disposal at allTimes. The skills are sweet. Totally worth the money.,2,2
I personally have 3 of these in my home and we love them. I love the fact that I can set restrictions for my kids. Great product,2,2
I originally purchased the Amazon fire stick which I did not like at all! it was very slow and it didn't stream Netflix well. I returned the fire stick in exchange for the Amazon fire TV and holy cow what a difference. Everything streams so quickly and it works tremendously well with Wi-Fi. Only bad thing is you have to restart it from time to time to refresh the system.,2,2
"was easy to set up, easy to use somethings are limited like music unless you have a prime account, like music, however I did find out you can use pandora or music saved on your phone. Overall a great product still learning new stuff everyday.",2,2
"I have enjoyed this Kindle Fire. Each day, I find something new to explore and I'm thrilled I purchased it.",2,2
Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.,2,2
Works as it should and gives us the ability to stream 4K.,2,2
It's a cheap version to allow my wife to read books and such. No pretense that it's anything like an iPad but it's doing exactly what it should do for the price point it's set at.,1,2
"This is my first streaming TV device and I am new to the technology. It was very easy to set up and configure, taking only a few minutes. It worked like a charm! I then downloaded Kodi onto the device, following a youtube instructional video. While Kodi takes a little more patience and time, once installed, it is an awesome supplement to the Fire TV. Between the built-in service offerings and the vast amount of free streaming services offered via Kodi, this device is a 100% winner!!! No more cable and satellite TV subscriptions for this person!!",2,2
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!,2,2
"I get this for my 11 years old daughter ... Is good, basic tablet",2,2
Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.,2,2
Works as well as any of the other more expensive tablets. Resolution is great and size is practical.,2,2
"When I first grabbed an echo I thought it would be kinda gimmicky, but I loved it so much I bought two more echos and several dots. I have Alexa all over the house. The smart home integration is so wonderful. I feel like I am living in Star Trek when Alexa turns my lights on and off and does other tasks.",2,2
Easy to use. Awesome price. Best Buy had in stock when amazon didn't. Recommend.,2,2
"love these so much we now have 4 Echo (Kitchen, living room, basement and outdoor area) and 2 Dots for bedrooms. Now that they can play everywhere together it's great going from one room to another with music playing in all rooms when we are entertaining. Highly recommend!",2,2
"It is great to read books on the go! Easy to use, and easy to add pdf's and other files you may want on there!",2,2
Good tablet for a beginner. Easy to navigate and get more apps!,2,2
Just excellent product.great sound.great features.answers most questions.,2,2
I had this kind of tablet before. I like it therefore I I purchased it again. I do recommend this tablet.,2,2
I wish ir had all the free aps on Google play store. I am finding I have to pay for alot of the free ones I am use to.,2,2
Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi,2,0
Bought this for my son for Learning and fun we take it everywhere with us works great,2,2
The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!,2,2
"Minimizes buffering, don't have to have wireless internet. Seems to load faster then the stick.",2,2
It does everything a regualur tablet can do and it cheap,2,2
"The Amazon Fire TV box is better than using the ""smart"" software built-in on any Blu-ray player or TV I've owned. Those brands include Sony, Mitsubishi, and Samsung. It is very responsive when navigating menus and making selections. If you're not an Amazon Prime member, be prepared to have that in your face - this is an Amazon device after all. The remote is minimalist in style and has the mic built-in for speaking to Alexa, which is a plus in my book.",2,2
I love it. These things are sold out everywhere. Except at BestBuy.,2,2
"Had all kinds of problems in registering it and getting it to work Had Customer service from Best Buy, Amazon and my internet provider trying to help, but to no avail.",0,2
I love my fire... The games and the pictures great,2,2
It was an amazing deal for my little cousin. This is a great tablet!!,2,2
"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader.",2,2
My granddaughter Bella love this alexa so I got her another one for Easter,2,2
Great deal and wonderful product. Saving money on cabls,2,2
love it. does what it does extremely well. The fastest box i own and I've owned them all.,2,2
Great device. Much faster than the Amazon fire stick.,2,2
I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.,2,2
My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.,2,2
"Would have to think about purchasing this at full price. I got another one this year for the black friday, $30 price. After adding a microSD card I use them for large Ipod alternatives. A lot cheaper than buying the Ipod and does the same thing.",2,2
"I bought this grudgingly as a way to read in bed without a light that bothered my wife. As it turns out I'm really glad I did. The light is adjustable and the ""print"" is crisp and clear. Even better is the ability to enlarge the print which has been helpful to my old eyes. There is a great ebook selection available from the library and many cheap books available on Amazon.",2,2
Very fast at loading apps and downloading movies and TV shows. Would highly recommend. Also have a firestick and the box is much faster and has more memory.,2,2
The point of a kindle is to read it like a paper print and this product achieves that. I considered the higher level products but settled on this as the best value option. The product met expectation.,2,2
"Have enjoyed this kindle, especially for the price.",2,2
Excellent low cost table. Fair for the price!!!!!!!!,2,2
Good product with best price available in the market place,2,2
"You can't beat the price...Picked this one up for only $60 from Best Buy..I like the additional control parents have with kindles. It's great when you want to limit your kid's time on youtube, games etc. I would certainly recommend this to a friend..",2,2
"I toyed with the idea of getting an Echo. Now that I have one, I love Alexa. She lives in the kitchen: ""Alexa, set the timer for 10 minutes."" Using IFTTT.com, she integrates with my Nest thermostat, my Rachio watering system, etc. She lets me know when stuff from Amazon is coming. She is there to answer questions. But she can be annoying when Jeopardy is on the TV. Some contestants with the right voice will give their answer -- remember, the answer is a question -- ""Who is Queen Elizabeth II?"" And, Alexa will tell you all about Queen Elizabeth II. How can you not love her?",2,2
Small and cheap gift for my nieces who like to listen to bible stories,2,2
GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.,2,0
Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.,1,2
It's slick and small and it works great! I love it,2,2
Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.,2,2
"I bought the Echo for my bedroom, but moved it more central to the house so that I could use it more. It's super convenient to be able to just say something out loud and have her take note of what you need. From playing Alt Nation on Sirius XM to setting a timer to needing the weather at a vacation destination, Alexa always has the answer. My only complaint is that when I have music playing loudly, Alexa does not respond to turning off, but it's such a minor issue. The music quality is unreal from such a small unit! I'm definitely buying more for around the house.",2,2
Perfect for kids with the child profile. Only downside is the limited space,2,2
Bought this to run the Kodi app. It's awesome!!!!!,2,2
This product is the best item HANDS DOWN! Love IT!,2,2
This Kindle is amazing for children and tweens. Its sturdy and light and fun to use.,2,2
Very good experience okay at the Niles Ohio location. Great price for children 6 to 11 that aren't real responsible. Did not buy warranty on the tablets priced a little high for something that was as priced as low as they were.,1,2
"Good for streaming off internet , no buffering on Lodi and live tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,2
"I purchased this as a temporary tablet after my old one died. Now, I have no desire to buy a different tablet any time soon. For the price, it is great. It does everything that I require a tablet to do, especially after paying the $15 on Amazon to disable ads. Well worth the price.",2,2
"great for the whole family, there is something for everyone, all ages!",2,2
Opened it up and didn't realize it was what he had almost bought for himself.A lot of fun and very helpful in answering questions we have.Will expand to work with home appliances on birthday's. Love it.,2,2
Bought this to get rid of cable tv. Works great ! Very easy to set up and was able to get this working in no time.,2,2
"The Echo is a cool speaker and has some neat tricks if you're vested in the Amazon universe. I am not. It's still neat as a bluetooth speaker, but if it weren't on sale, I would not find as much utility for the price.",2,2
"The whole family likes talking to Alexa. It provides lots of tips, answers, songs, etc. Of course it gets much better after you train it and download more skills. Great product.",2,2
Bought for my son and he loves it. Fast and great for playing games,2,2
"Its a great all around tablet, with all the extra features you need if your an avid reader.",2,2
Works as expected,2,2
"Love the tablet, just wish they had included a booklet with it and not just an on line referral. Since this is not my first tablet I was familiar with things, but for a new user, I think a booklet of some sort would be a help",2,2
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,0,2
"Great for children, nonexpensive very durable easy to use",2,2
This wall charger works exactly as described for the Kindle Paperwhite.,2,2
"I have the first version, and I can't wait to see my son face when he gets for Christmas",2,2
Worth the money when on sale-slow connection compared to a laptop,1,2
Nice for music and home automation control. Used ha-bridge to call home genie api uri's.,2,2
Enjoyed it so much on one tv we decided to put itOn an additional tv in bedroom. Will be phasing out of DIRECTV soon.,2,2
"Alexa is great for keeping shopping lists,controllong my wemo switches and playing music. As good as Siri for trivia, but they still both have a way to go to become less frustrating. Liked product so much we purchased the dot for upstairs and it works equally as well.",2,2
Love my new Kindle Voyage. I have an original Kindle but this one does so much more. Recommend it highly.,2,2
Works fine for me.,2,2
Brought for my mom and she loves it worth every penny,2,2
"Got it at a very good price, and it did not disappoint me. Mainly used by my kids, I can set up and control exactly what they can view, read and play. Each one has his own user, so they can personalize their experience with it as well. Works well, does the job, and again, at a very good price.",2,2
"It's a wonderful tablet and e-reader for what you pay. My only complaint is it's a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive. I also don't like that I can't put my ebooks on my memory card. It's frustrating. Other than that, it's wonderful.",2,2
Love it. Makes home automation a breeze. Easy setup,2,2
This was a simple set up. Worked immediatel . We added the net gear extender due to the size of our house and llocation of our tv.,2,2
I had wanted a Fire for about 3 Years but didn't pick one up but this time I did. Wasn't what I thought it would be like.,1,1
"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect.",2,2
"I love my my fire TV, it has everything you need to stream shows/movies to your TV.",2,2
Everything I wanted. Still learning on using her..,2,2
The Kindle Paperwhite works exactly as expected. I have no complaints.,2,2
"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......",2,2
I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ...,2,2
This was a Christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it!,2,2
"What a deal, this tablet has all you need to get basic things accomplished and enough power to complete more difficult tasks. Highly recommended for the price, value",2,2
PURCHASED FOR A 92 YEAR YOUNG LADY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY BEJEWLED BLITZ. SHE LOVES IT !,2,0
This is my second paperwhite kindle & I can't imagine not having one with me all the time.,2,2
"Worth getting, great for the priceAnd very handy for movies and music",2,2
I love the voice command and online resources !!!!,2,2
Got a great deal. I don't think I'd spend more than $100 on it. Works well with xm though.,2,2
Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.,2,2
"I love the versatility of the Echo, It has a great music sound and does so much more.",2,2
My first kindle. Really like it. Glad I bought it!,2,2
works for my purposes. It is easy to use and easy for my kids to use,2,2
Couldnt have been a better product for day to day reading,2,2
My favorite feature is that it will play almost any music you ask it to and it answers almost anything you ask it.,2,2
Great product. Amazon got it again. Can browse everything I need with ease.,2,2
We bought this tablet for my son for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for a kid and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it for a person who's not big on technology. It's definitely not an IPad!!!!,1,0
"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase.",2,2
"Echo is a nice addition to my ahem becoming automated home (not close). What I like with it are easy to use and setup, there still a lot of improvement to do but overall it's nice to have it as long the maker of it will continue to update Alexa to keep up with.this fast paced technology of us.",2,2
I love this kindle. You can read clear in bright sunlight and it's so easy to carry around. The letters are crisp and easy to read. It's just like holding a book but without the curling pages. You will not be disappointed.,2,2
"Easy to install. Great for playing music. Check the weather, news with just a question?",2,2
Got this for my 3 yo and he is enjoying it. The case is worth it's price in gold.,2,2
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this.",2,2
"This is a great device for book readers! It's larger than the former kindle, has great light and easy to operate.",2,2
great tablet and very easy to use. very easy to grab and go,2,2
"Love the ease to use,the back light, and the size. Previous kindle died after 10 years was worried I would not like the changes but now I read even more because of the ease of using and light.",2,2
I love my Echo. I use it everyday. I recommend it.,2,2
Lots of features at a great price. I would recommend this product.,2,2
"The screen is beautiful. It does everything the iPad can do if not more. You are definitely not settling for less but, keeping more money in your pocket if you choose this device over and iPad.",2,2
I love this device! It works so well and is easy on the eyes. Having on device hold all of my books and being able to get new books so easily is the best feature for someone like me who is an avid reader.,2,2
"Thought I'd be enjoying this more. Clever interface when Alexa gets it right, more frustrating than it should be when she gets you wrong!",1,2
"My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better.",2,2
Works great and KODI is totally worth the price becaus you save a lot on not having to use Netflix anymore,2,2
Easy to hook up and use. Great sound. I use this device in many ways every day!,2,2
I am very satisfied with my Kindle Fire. I am amazed how good it is for the price. I am visually impaired and the voice over is excellent.,2,2
Awesome for the price perfect for little ones if you don't want to worry about them cracking the screen or dropping the product and paying a lot of money,2,2
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime,2,2
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.,2,2
Can't play word games or monopoly but other than that great,2,2
Got these for our kids when we go on vacation. Easy for them to use.,2,2
"I was looking for a tablet that I could download movies on for my toddler to watch on long car rides. This Kindle Fire has great parental settings so I don't have to worry about my child accidentally buying things or seeing inappropriate content. This runs much cleaner and faster than older generation Fires. I was a little taken back by the size since I have a much bigger one, but It'll work out great for what I wanted it for. I did notice I have 2 burnt out pixels, but they don't bother me enough to return or exchange.",2,2
I think the concept is modern & works well most of the time. We have had to pair it several times but that may be our internet service. The most frustrating think is when you have named the bulbs and say Alexa hallway light on/off she doesn't understand what you are saying and repeats something totally different.,2,2
"While I have used an ipad in the past, this is hands down a huge improvement in the ability to read books. The backlighting and type font are great and it is extremely easy to download books.",2,2
"when I compare the screen of this voyage to my previous paperwhite, the qualify of the display was much better. light is more even and soft.",2,2
"What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can't say how many times it's hit the floor and no damage.",2,2
I bought this for my 8 year old. Very cost effective and lots of fun for him.,2,2
"This was a perfect gift for my daughter, especially as she gets ready to go to college.",2,2
Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,2,2
This is a very affordable tablet for a kid just bought a case online. And it's perfect for taking it around.,2,2
Easy setup and I never get tired of using it. My wife uses Echo all the time.,2,2
I love it!! I would definately refer my friends and family to buy one for their TV's also,2,2
need more expects on tablet & computer with nohow.,2,2
"Got this for my fianc and she loves how easy it is to use, and how light the product is. Would highly recommend to all book readers.",2,2
"This was bought as a replacement for an older kindle fire that my mother had worn out! Very easy to use! My mother still uses a flip phone, because she doesn't like dealing with new technology, but she uses her kindle everyday and without and issues. Definitely recommend for elderly consumers. The only issue is the charger port! That's what went wrong with her last fire. Desperately needs reworking, if not already in the works.",2,2
"Love this hardware!! Only issue is occasionally you have to do a hard reset of the box, I was getting messages my bandwith wasn't high enough and couldn't watch streaming movies. Once I turned off/turned on...back to normal. That's the only issue so far. Otherwise highly recommend and love it!",2,2
"I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills. Would recommend as an accessory to a smart home, or for someone invested in the Amazon Eco System.",2,2
"I like to use my Echo to set my Alarm. I just say, ""Alexa, set my alarm for 6:30 am."" and I am confident that Alexa will lead me into the next morning.",2,2
GreAt Sceen love to watched movies and my favorite tv snows!!,2,2
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media.",2,2
Great personal assistant. Sometimes when music is playing loud Alexa can't here or understand the commands. Speaker is more powerful than expected. Ties in nicely with smart home appliances. Looks like this is more compatible with 3rd party devices than the Google Home.,2,2
"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.",1,2
Worth the money it is a very useful device . Buy this if you are an avid reader,2,2
I enjoy being able to play my rain music and falling asleep with ease.,2,2
Bought this for my elderly aunt. Was able to customize it so that it would be very simple to use for games. Amazon customer service is amazing.,2,2
I have purchased two of these for my children. This is sturdy and easy to use. There are parental controls as well. My 12 y/o and my 10 y/o operate these with ease. I am thinking of purchasing one as a gift for my mother.,2,2
You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 3 year old it's ok,1,2
"Have basic kindle and operation of Paperwhite is much different, catching on as I use it. Nice unit.",2,2
"This is a fun and convenient toy; however, it doesn't have the capability to answer as many re questions as I would have thought.",2,2
"wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money.",2,2
"Got this on a lark for my 9 yr old and mother-in-law who does not have a smart phone because of the Black Friday price. It's good for the price, but the picture quality is okay. I hope it lasts.",2,1
"Purchased as a gift for daughter and she hasn't put it down yet.This is now her go to device over her laptop,MP3 player or phone. To me that speaks volumes!",2,2
"The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!",2,2
"Works as expected, simple setup and works perfect!",2,2
It was bought for my husband and he has truly enjoyed it.,2,2
I will recommend for other parents to buy this product,2,2
"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",0,0
The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.,2,2
I hate the ads. They are annoying and you cannot get them off. It's super confusing how to even get to the home page,1,2
Does every thing I would need it to. Nice inexpensive tablet.,2,2
"The Amazon Echo is great. It was easy to set up. Alexis tells me the weather, plays anything I ask her and adjusts the volume at my request! Amazing.",2,2
"After having this for a year, it got a bit wet and called Kindle and they said they would fix it or replace it cause it was within the one year warranty. They replaced it for free.",2,0
it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading,2,2
Good movies kids. RUNS FAST. EFFICIENT. COOL TABLET.,2,2
I own 4 Kindles and I love them all. Purchsed the new Paperwhite because it had free 3G just wish they would make the capacity larger,2,2
You can do a lot with these. No pain in a smart tv when you can add one of these. The box is considerably faster than the stick but the stick is the best value.,2,2
"Alexa is revolutionary. She does so many things. No reason to be jealous. Bring her home,invite her in!",2,2
"I had the original fire stick and I don't truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version. I was hoping that whe. The new version came out I could really understand and justify why I was paying more for a new one, when my old one worked just fine. Unfortunately, I can't. For me, it's not worth the money and I returned the item and stuck with my other one.",0,0
My daughter gave me one of these as a gift. My wife liked it so much I replaced her Kindle touch with a Paperwhite. Nice step up from the regular Kindle touch. We both love the backlight.No more booklights while reading at night!,2,2
"Okay, glad it holds alot of books, wish it had send & received email.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my son to watch movies and play games on and it has proven to be a great tablet so far. Would definitely recommend this tablet to any other buyer. It is tough and sturdy.,2,2
"get the kindle during Black Friday where I think it's the only time kindle get discount. hesitate to get it for a long time since already have the iPad, but want to do more reading, so, why not",2,2
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.,2,2
"I had an old kindle, and its battery was beginning to fail. The Kindle Fire 7 replaces it, with much more functionality. It does, however, require charging more often.",2,2
Speakers give off Great Sound. And my kids love it.,2,2
"Echo seems well engineered. The voice response is very natural and usually understands what I'm saying. Echo wouldn't connect to my home WiFi because I had two networks with the same SSIDs (one 2.4ghz and one 5ghz). Once I changed the name (SSID) of one of the networks, Echo connected right up and hasn't had any trouble since. Because of the WiFi issue, I took 1 star away.",2,2
"This Fire tablet is great -- does all I want it to Only down side, the battery only lasts a few hours and has to be recharged often. I like to read -- sometimes, while reading, have to stop and recharge. Otherwise, I love it!!",2,2
"My Echo's power adapter began making a tiny but very audible noise that was disconcerting. My Echo continued to work well, but I needed to get rid of the aggravating and disconcerting noise, so I bought another adapter. This adapter works without making any noise. I am pleased with it.",2,0
Love my new Kindle. It was time to replace my old one. Everything is so much bet,2,2
I basically use it to read news articles and stories online. It works well for what I use it for.,2,2
"Easy to use, light weight, very good price. Highly recommend this product!",2,2
"For 50 bucks, it's a nice starter tablet. Wish it had Bluetooth but can't really complain at this price",2,2
Great tablet to teach young children . Grandchildren love it to watch favorite you tube shows,2,2
"Echo does exactly as advertised. It will tell you the weather, jokes and some fun facts. using the skills you can add different features and for the most part they work. For it to really be big it has to continue to add features that the everyday user has an interest in. If you don't get the wording just right echo will not carry out the command. in the skills set you always have to start with a common phrase to get it to understand. This could be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work. Overall a great product well made and has great potential to be the star of the home automation.",2,2
Great product for online streaming. Way better than cable,2,2
keeps me busy great tablet I am always home bored now I am stuck on Netflix and play my games do my homework log into to work,2,2
Highly better alternative then the Fire Stick. Faster UI and perferomance compared to the Fire Stick.,2,2
"I love talking to Alexa on Amazon Echo!The set up was fast and easy to do. Just plug it in and follow the easy instructions that Alexa gives you. I loved it so much, I bought one for my brother!!",2,2
"This device does everything. I get news, jokes, stock quotes, sports scores, etc. Plus it maintains my shopping list",2,2
"The Amazon Fire TV is definitely one of the top media streamers on the market today. It allows for 4K playback which only a few other devices can do, ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed, and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps. If you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end",2,2
"My first amazon tablet does not have any removable or expandable memory feature and when I saw that this product has one, I got so excited for this one. Very good display and easy to use for new users. First time tablet users will get a tutorial how to navigate the product so there is no hassle for beginners.",2,2
I will be buying these everyone I know! fantastic price too,2,2
"I ended up returning it, but it's nothing really wrong with the device itself. Despite the low specs, it was mostly responsive and pretty snappy, though I've owned better. I'm just not super invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so I was missing things that other tablets have access to, like Nook/Kobo stores, Microsoft Office, and the like. Good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it.",2,0
"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap.",2,2
"I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet.",2,2
"Have connected it to my ""smart"" home and now am able to manage lights, security and temperatures with my voice or smart phone. Mine is in kitchen and it makes a wonderful device to time cooking and baking. And it plays my music.",2,2
"This was a gift for my 18 year old little sister. Well worth it for the price, she really likes it",2,2
This tablet is great for entertainment purposes especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. Easy to use and access to most entertainment apps make this tablet and easy purchase especially if you get it on sale for less than $50. Great buy!,2,2
"Ive only had one tablet before this one so its great that this tablet didnt ""lose me"" in technology and also do everything I bought it for at the same time.",2,2
"Purchased this for my granddaughter, she is 13 and loves it",2,2
My kid love this tablet. Very good quality with affordable price.,2,2
"This is a great choice for kids is simple, not expensive and a great alternative.",2,2
"It took me a good 6 months to finally purchase one of these but now I am so glad I did! I can ask Alexa anything I would normally Google, set a timer for cooking, listen to music, etc. I've just purchased so I know there's so much more that can be done and I really look forward to learning more about the product. I've ""liked"" the Alexa FB page which gives me new things to try each day. Love this item!",2,2
My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use,2,2
Satisfied customer with product for small child. Very durable. Amazon fire rocks,2,2
My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.,2,2
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice,2,2
This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,2
great product...will buy again...like it's versility and ease of use,2,2
"Very fast, no buffering and better than fire stick when you use hardwired Ethernet.",2,2
I you're a part of the amazon world - i.e. prime. This is incredible for the price - it just works and you can add memory to the 8gb for bringing along videos if you not on the web.,2,2
"Very inexpensive, good size and weight to carry, added a 64 gb memory card and I have everything I need, from books to videos.",2,2
"My mother has the larger Amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. The tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so I returned it.",1,0
"I bought this as a replacement for my wife's old Kindle 3g. I got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g. I have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others. My wife really misses the physical keyboard, but she has quickly gotten used to the touch-screen. The dpi is MUCH better, and the screen is much easier to read. The refresh times are a lot better. I don't see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working, but you shouldn't hesitate if you're in the market for an excellent e-book reader.",2,2
"I just purchased this Kindle to replace my first generation kindle. I am so happy with my purchase. It is much easier to use, read, hold and charge. It is a worthwhile investment!",2,2
Kids Kindle was a Christmas present for great grandson age 4. His mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from Amazon's childrens library. A big feature of the Kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. His Mother says he loves the Kindle and uses it all the time. Great purchase.,2,2
this equipment will help us with our viewing of movies that we want.,2,2
"Very happy with my purchase, found exactly what I was looking for when I walked in to the store.",2,2
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.,2,2
Its awaesome. I love it. The price is worth it to buy it.,2,2
"Bought this for my 5yr and she loves it. We are still learning how to work it together, but so far so good.",2,2
"The Amazon Echo is a really fun thing to play with. We always try to find new things to say to it which would make it say something funny. The Echo has been the most helpful in our home for creating shopping lists for everyone in the house with a phone. If any of us find ourselves at the store, we know what the others want. Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well. There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more.",2,2
"Was considering the HD version, but realized the specs weren't very different. A good tablet for the price paid.",2,2
I replaced a lost e-reader on the plane with a new one.,2,2
Very good tablet for a beginner. Very easy to use. However wished the color on the screen was better.,2,2
This is a must have product for the home. ..........,2,2
I bought this kindle to replace my aging kindle fire 2 nd generation. Battery life is improved with new features. Display is excellent. Love having a camera. Very happy customer!!!!,2,2
this purchase was not for me but i decided ti purchase it for my wifeher name is rebecca.,2,2
I wore out my first generation paperwhite......onto the next! Kindle paperwhites are the way to go!,2,2
I love this Kindle. Easy to read outside in the daylight. It is much lighter than my previous version. I just ordered a new case for it.,2,2
Was at a family members house. This is cool so I bought one,2,2
"love these boxes! use them on a regular basis, would recomend",2,2
We bought 2 of these for Xmas kids love them great,2,2
Will purchase again. Great delivery. Great customer service,2,2
It's great only issue is wish the o.s was more open and you could delete more of the things you dont want,2,2
"We had one before and it was stolen so we got another and loving it as always, great thing to have on the go or when you don't want a bunch of books all over",2,2
Ny son really enjoys playing his games on his tablet. It was good purchase at a awesome price.,2,2
I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for.,2,2
"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2.",2,2
I own the Apple TV and I wanted to try out the Fire TV and am glad I did.,2,2
Christmas gift for my nieces & they absolutly loved them.....,2,2
"Works great, easy to setup, simple to navagate, layout and options are easily to use",2,2
"I love this product - light weight, easy on the eyes, glare-free.",2,2
Pretty basic tablet. Lagging processor but it works.,1,2
Love it.. Would highly recommend. I use it everyday.,2,2
"This was purchased as a gift, but I now have the intention of purchasing for myself, because of how much they love it.",2,2
It's an amazing product I stand behind it! Good job,2,2
It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.,1,2
"I was happy with the Echo but because I'm all Google I returned and went with the Google home. As far as the Echo the speaker was really good, picked up my voice from everywhere around my apartment (google home doesn't do as good as Alexa) Its a great toy for anyone",2,2
I have been a kindle user for years and I expect a certain level of quality. This version falls short. Constantly freezes.,0,2
Replacing my son's 5 year old computer. He love the apple products,2,2
my moms favortie gift of chrismas 2015. i would recommend is product over and over.,2,2
Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.,2,2
I LIKE THE FIRE TV STREAMING MEDIA PLAYER. IT WORKS WELL.,2,1
"Works the way it should. However I am baffled that there is no way to set up recurring reminders (aka take pills, etc).",2,2
"This is a fun and helpful device. Alexa can answer almost anything you ask her; if she can't - reword your question and try again. I use her for weather, sports, music, mileage, and much more.",2,2
Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,1,2
"Gets the job done nicely. It's as convenient as using a cell phone, but just a larger screen. Great for reading e books and catching up with shows on line.",2,2
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use,2,2
this tablet works great and is a great price made great christmas presents,2,2
I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.,2,2
"Took a while to get one since all stores were out of stock. Ended up ordering online and getting free shipping. Has all apps plus HBO Now which is great. So far, so good!",2,2
This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.,2,2
This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.,2,2
"I thought there would be a bigger step up from the fire stick. Honestly, if you want to save money, just go with the fire stick.",1,2
"great, always a great time vising the store of my choice",2,2
Amazon is always producing great products for a affordable price.,2,2
"This tablet is really good, very much user friendly.",2,2
"This is actually our 2nd Echo for our house. We had one for downstairs, and this one is for upstairs. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, you should definitely get this as it is about the same price as other speakers, has great sound, plus you get the voice control. Alexa voice control is good for playing music, asking about the weather, adding things to a list, setting timers, etc. The only downside is that she is much more limited in her knowledge than Siri is, she can't play from iTunes or apple music, or connect to iPhone notes. It is completely Amazon and other than apple having an app, that is as far as the iPhone integration goes. Overall, a great speaker with the benefits of voice control and other features.",2,2
This is a good alternative for those who don't like the chromecast. Not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good.,2,2
"I bought this to control lights and play music from pandora, Amazon prime and phone. Works very well. Alexa response is acceptable but not as good as 'Okay Google'",2,2
Bought for kids and really they enjoying. Size is small but compact for kids,2,2
If you don't have cable this is a good thing to have. Great product. & you can even jail break it.,2,2
"My previous tablets have been androids, so I don't care for the navigation on the home page. It has take some getting used to. However, it's nice to have an actual Kindle when I read my books, as opposed to just the app.",2,2
"I was first introduced to this product by a friend and ever since I had seen what it is capable of, I not only bought one, but two! I have referred this device to several family members along with friends and they all agreed how impressive it is.",2,2
"Nice ereader for reading books. Browser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is ads pop up which amazon shud fix",2,2
"So, I pretty much got this as a cheap tablet for my 2 year old. He's constantly snagging people's cell phones to play games. We figured this was inexpensive enough that if he breaks out in the next two years, it's still better than if he breaks one of our phones on contact. Overall, it's a great little tablet for the money, and we can set parental controls on it so it can grow with him over the next few years. Not bad.",2,2
"The Fire TV is easy to hookup and easy to use. Lots of apps. Alexa is fun and useful for programming questions, weather and controlling some of my smart home lights. The request would be to control TV volume on the remote.",2,2
Bought as a gift seems to be very easy-to-use and portable light weight too,2,2
"I've done everything with Alexa from Pandora, the Nest thermostat and iheart. Getting one more for when we go to El Salvador.",2,2
"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!",2,2
Bought this for my twelve year old grandson to replace his two year old Kindle Fire. He loved the blue color and said it was like his friends mini pad.,2,2
"Can't complain for the price of it on sale it does what it should at the speed that is appropriate,",2,2
"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong.",2,2
"I bought this tablet for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! He reads pdf's from work on this tablet and can easily study with it. He says it doesn't hurt his eyes and I couldn't have purchased a better gift for him. If you're thinking about it, go for it and get it! I got a pretty good deal on it, $100!!",2,2
"I really enjoy my Alexa. I use it for news briefs, listening to music and a playing games",2,2
Good little tablet. But I don't like that there is not a big choice of apps.,2,2
"Had one of these 2 years ago, got this one on sale and I usually pay more for a dinner. Does everything you need and plus you can expand the memory.",2,2
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.,2,0
Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.,2,2
"I never thought I'd be an e-reader person, always preferred a paper book. I am dyslexic and decided to try out this Kindle at the recommendation of a friend. I LOVE IT! I've read more books since I bought it last month than I have in years! Reasons it is perfect for dyslexics: You can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica. Another thing that I like about the Paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a LED one like most electronic devices. It eliminates eye strain and the ""blue light"" issues at night. I also love that our library has the ability to borrow e-books, which has helped me save money on the books.",2,2
Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!,2,2
Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book,2,2
I really enjoy my kindle easy to download books and easy to read on the beach,2,2
I'm able to screen mirror from my tablet and android.,2,2
This is my first tablet. I has been fun learning how to use it. Great price.,2,2
"Works smoothly, no problems. Amazin has a great selection of tv shows and movies.",2,2
"Solid unit for reading and the occasional TV show or game.Those coming from a full featured tablet may find themselves frustrated at some of the limitations and quirks of Amazon's walled garden, but if your are looking for something cheap they does what it says on the box, you can't go wrong.",2,2
I really enjoy my tablet. It does everything that I was looking for in a tablet. Easy to use and small.,2,2
"I am still learning what it will do so far very pleased when I ask it something it answers, I played Christmas music all day long and was pleased",2,2
I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt,2,2
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price,2,2
"Had a kindle before, needed new one. Like the size",2,2
my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.,2,2
This tablet is very reasonably priced for children and I love the insurance replacements. Must have for the young ones.,2,2
This charger is improved from the other one I had. It takes less time to fully charge and the charge lasts longer.,2,2
This box is better then the fire stick I can finally look at 4K movies with this box then I could look on the fire stick and it handles my internet very well which is 5.0ghz wifi no problem,2,2
"I found this device was easy to hook up, also easy to navagate perfect box for beginners and advanced users",2,2
Easy set up. Great features. Can't beat the price.,2,2
"Amazons's ECHO is everything good you might have heard - as long as you are a $100 a year Prime member but, why wouldn't you with all it has to offer.",2,2
Bought this on black Fri. Great tablet for the price.,2,2
Love it! Easy to navigate! Even my toddler can do it!,2,2
"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!",2,2
Awesome product! If you enjoy reading this is a must have.,2,2
We love our new echo. I'm sure as time goes on it will just. Keep getting better with updates.,2,2
"When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice.",1,2
This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life.,2,2
"My experience with Alexa it's been pretty good ,the grandkids love to ask questions as she have an answer for each and everyone.",2,2
I love traveling so this has been perfect for taking books wherever I go.,2,2
"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes.",2,2
"Quick Easy setup, fun & We use it all the time! Checking our commute, weather, jokes, recipes, to helpful to mention it all!",2,2
Overall the Amazon echo Alexa is a phenomenal product but will grow much more with time. There are a few issues but that's to be expected!,2,2
Takes a while to get data programmed so you don't get a lot of I don't understand,2,2
i bought them for my grand kids.they will enjoy them ask for a computer for christmas,2,2
Does what it says it does and is small and convenient!,2,2
Love all the options with the Fire TV. A lot of games and apps to help stop cable.,2,2
"I bought this tablet for a Christmas for a family member gift even thought I wasn't too sure of the quality of this tablet because it was very inexpensive. The person who received the tablet was very satisfied with the speed, screen resolution and apps.",2,2
Very good for what I wanted it for. Great speaker.,2,2
"I can't return through Best Buy, because it's over 15 days. Started out ok, but then it just stopped working. It keeps freezing at home screen and I can't access anything. Extremely disappointed.",0,0
I love this echo. It's literally one of my favorite gifts that I purchased for my family. We love how it understands very well and does almost exactly what we say. Whenever I forget something for food shopping I literally ask Alexa to put it in my cart and it does just that! It's the perfect little helper around the house. Just what I needed!,2,2
"Gave this as a gift. My friend liked the tablet and it is pretty inexpensive. The only problem is that flixster app is no longer available/compatible with Amazon so, she is not able to watch movies she owns on flixster.",2,2
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.,2,2
"Bought this for my nephew. The price is right, however, the tablet is terrible. Spend the money and get an iPad.",0,2
it's and super cool device for music streaming. it's also voice activated.,2,2
"This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k.",2,2
My son bought this with his own money during Black Friday. It was his 4th Kindle Fire. Definitely an upgrade from his previous generation model. I love the durability and extended ability to accept a larger sd card. Screen is notably better. He travels with me on work trips and having an Amazon Prime and Netflix account for this thing makes it the perfect travel companion.,2,2
I love having Alexa around. When you have your hands full you can still get information or set a timer without having to empty your hands or wash the meatloaf off first. I can't wait to see what all she can do.,2,2
"I am so happy I chose the Echo over the Google. Clear sound, listens better than google. More knowledgable than google, answers all questions correctly.",2,2
They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.,1,1
Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids,2,2
Very easy setup via smartphone App. Easy to use. Like the shopping list feature.,2,2
"I love this paper white! It's light weight, easy to use, and the battery lasts for a very long time with use. I only wish it were cheaper, but the price wasn't bad.",2,2
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.,1,2
This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.,2,2

best buy matching prices was great it did match the price offered by other vendors thats why i always go to best buy for all my gadgets need,2,2

Brought for christmas gift mother loves it use all time,2,2
"Gift for my parents, easy for them to use! They loved it!",2,2
My daughter absolutely loves this tablet! It has a lot of great apps that she can choose from in the app store too. She's had no problems with her tablet. I've even had fun using her tablet and it's simple to use.,2,2

"Great tablet for the price. Got it on sale for $39. To my surprise, it has bluetooth.",2,2
I love this it was the best thing I brought My kids even love it and it easy for or them to use,2,2
I was familiar with the previous paperwhite lower res product that was fine. For the price it is a great reader. The new higher res standing side by side is an improvement. Would recommend.,2,2
Very easy to use set up was really use I love all of the channels,2,2
This tablet is okay for moderate use. Mine tends to lag while playing games or surfing the internet..,1,2
great- easy to set up- great gift item- small and fits in purse!,2,2
Nice price drop to $139.00. Admittedly a device that makes your prime membership much more sticky but love accessing prime music through it,2,2
Great product! Easy integration with Samsung Smartthings hub and music apps such as Spotify. It also delivers great sound with the size of the speaker.,2,2
This works well for those that like movies! I personally appreciate the ease of use.,2,2

Bday gift for my 10 year old. He loves it! And the price was perfect.,2,2
My family love it and y husband is crazy with this,2,2
I use my echo to play my music and control my hue lights which works difficult to understand at first;but not more than a 15 minutes can't solve.,2,2
Its great love to watch my favorite shows and read books,2,2
Bought for my wife. Great product. Easy to set up and use.,2,2
"Simple, everything works no problems. We bought for my mother in law . She loves it.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.,2,2
Fast and responsive. Well worth the price for the convenience.,2,2
20 for a USB charger is outrageous! It should have bee free with the Paperwhite Kindle.,1,2
Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.,2,2
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.,2,2
Really great item to have and would definitely recommend it,2,2
"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",2,2
Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues,2,2
"Great product. She seems like her favorite answers right now are I'm not sure about that, but I know it has a lot of great features",2,2
"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included",2,2
I had been reading on my iPad mini but I was scared it would damage it carry it around. This is perfect!!,2,2
Bought this as a gift for a child. They love it for playing games and watching videos.,2,2
This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.,2,2
I love Alexa and that lady knows everything. I have even hooked up some more functions to her.,2,2
"Alexa (AKA, Amazon Echo) Is A Complete And Absolutely Awesome Addition To My House And Home Automation, I've Even Brought Additional Smart Home Items For Her To Play With!!! Love That She's Always Learning.... Alexa Is Wroth The Investment!",2,2
A very nice gift for all. My mother loves it. Super,2,2
My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.,2,2
"This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability",2,2
"This was a Christmas present for my daughter, she reads big books very fast. When we bought the Kindle Paperwhiye we signed up for the Amazon Prime now she reads up to 5 books a week.",2,2
"I bought two one for my 5 year old and one for my grandmother. So easy to use, and they love it. Will buy more",2,2
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.,2,2
Got it for 35 bucks for my son and he loves it so I'm happy,2,2
Lightning fast no but still a great and inexpensive way to get the latest book release and maybe to check the news. Price was unbeatable,2,2
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.,2,2
The echo sounds great music fills up the room. Makes life easier answers your questions turns lights on and off weather news her skills are endless. I love it,2,2
Great for adults and kids!!! No need to be tech savvy with the Echo. Works Great and easy to use!!!!,2,2
"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended.",2,2
"The product works very well, but the user interface is too busy and not really tunable. It is also difficult to search for new apps that aren't already listed. Voice control works okay, but Alexa remains a far cry from Siri.",2,0
"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.",2,2
"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price.",2,2
"What a time we live in...Jetsons are real, this is a must have.",2,2
"This has been great for travelling. I can read and watch tv/movies, and not have to take out my computer. The price sealed the deal.",2,2
Just learning all the features this product is capable of providing,2,2
"Kindle Paperwhite strikes a nice balance between features and price. Amazon offers the best store for eBooks period. If you are looking to bring your reading hobby to the 21st century, you cannot go wrong.",2,2
My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere!,2,2
I love this product! My home automation is wonderful to be controlled by voice.,2,2

Good!,2,2
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use,2,2

My wife loves it,2,2
My kids are able to use this quite well. Can easily update all the applications.,2,2
Best device for Kodi. Works perfetly no issues at all,2,2
"Life battery very good , search engine very good.very fast.",2,2
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range.",2,2
"I bought this as a gift for my friend. I personally own 1 Alexa and 3 echo dots. This product is excellent, easy set up and easy to use. I would recommend this product over google home for one Alexa was the first to come out with this and a lot of tweeks and updates are posted in the email. I have my kitchen lights hooked up to Alexa and can use by dimming out my lights. Hope you will enjoy your Alexa as well as I did mine.",2,2
"I am very happy with this tablet. It was an upgrade from the Kindle paperwhite. The screen is very sharp, and the tablet is very lite.",2,2
"The Kindle Paperwhite has many improvements over my first Kindle with a lighted touch screen, wifi, and ability to swipe to turn the page. I love it!",2,2
Could never get into reading from a tablet like the iPad or even the Amazon kindle fire. It just didn't feel right. This device makes it feel as if you're reading actual paper print. It's amazing. I highly recommend it if your an avid reader.,2,2
My kids love their new tablets and it was a great price.,2,2
"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead",0,2
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.",2,2
Love it I download all of my audiobooks on my tablet,2,2
this was great for my wife who just needed a basic tablet for web browsing and media consumption.,2,2
My kids love the product. Really durable after drops.,2,2
"I wanted a replacement comparable to my original, and this filled the bill.",2,2
Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.,2,2
"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet",2,2
I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.,2,2
Great with the speaker adds good sound to the other features,2,2
"This is my 4th Fire tablet. They're so affordable, I buy them and end up giving them away to family members.",2,2
Trying to find a tablet to teach my father in law on who not tech savvy and it's perfect,2,2
Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.,2,2
"I bought the Kindle Fire mostly for use as an MP3. As a Black Friday deal of only $24.99, couldn't beat it. So far, it is working great as an MP3. I was able to download songs and playlists from my computer. Purchasing games and books have also been easy.",2,2
It was a gift to each of my children (3) for anniversaries/birthdays. They all love it for variety of movies and ease of setup and use. No complaints.,2,2
"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc.",0,0
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it.",2,2
I got it for my kids and they love it they are always playing with it,2,2
"This is my second Echo purchase. I use ""Alexa"" while getting ready in the morning. Instead of looking for a clock, I ask ""Alexa"" for the time 20 times in the morning.I use the Echo to set alarms, and to listen to news/music. The Echo can also play books via Audible. Oh! I also use my Echo to control my lights. Buy the Echo. It's usefulness is endless.",2,2
"Echo is very impressive. Unlimited entertainment. and is pretty decent speaker for music, spotify premium is awesome to use with it.",2,2
Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.,2,2
"This has a real loud sound, Alexa can turn off your light or play some music from your phone!",2,2
Good basic tablet for home and the kids. The only downside is that a credit/ debit card is required to link to the Amazon store even if you download a free app. I'm able to let the kids use apps and the Internet. I can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.,2,2
"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",2,2
I bought this for my son who has a speech disability. He uses it to communicate as well as play games. Great parental controls,2,2
I bought this Echo as a gift. I have had mine for about a year. The abilities of the echo device are constantly being improved.,2,2
"Being that I am already an Amazon prime member, I decided to purchase this to make use of Amazon video. I replaced my Chromecast with the Fire TV and couldn't be happier",2,2
Easy to use. I would recommend to others! Have friends who will buy one!,2,2
Essentially it works well for its intended purpose,2,2
"Our family enjoys our Amazon tv box, it's great expecially with the free movies and TV shows. I like the remote design better than the apple tv box, but that's just my opinion. It's a great addition to any tv because it makes searching and watching whatever you want effortless.",2,2
This tablet is very easy to use i bought it for my nephew and he's only 4 years old and he love it,2,2
"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light.",2,2
"Purchased for my wife so she can play games and not tie up her phone. Seems to play her games alright. It is a bit slow when opening things like the Internet, Facebook or Netflix. Still a decent little tablet for $39.99. Also limited to Amazon app store, so a lot of Android apps are not available (like dice with buddies).",2,0
"Mainly use it for playing music, was going to connect to Apple Music, but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offers a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for Alexa. I have an outlet switch connected which is convenient for turning on/off lights. It has a good speaker for playing music. I think Alexa is comparable to Siri.",2,2
Great Tablet for the price and works really well... Cannot go wrong with this Tablet,2,2
"It's nice for the price, nice gift for kids and grandparents",1,2
This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on.,2,2
I've been hemming and hawing about what eReader to buy for a while. This does everything I need a ebook to do.,2,2
Awesome product fully functional with my home theater and overall feel of my living room. good for playing music off spotify,2,2
"Excellent reader. We have Amazon Prime and access to a number of books with Amazom. Plus we utilize our local library. This paperwhite is excellent for reading at anytime. Good battery life.If you only need a reader, you can not buy a better one. If you want more, look at the Kindle Fire tablet. Good price.",2,2
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.,2,2
My wife loves it. She has been using the unit since she received it for a gift.,2,2
This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!,2,2
"I'm a big reader and love to read on the go! This makes it possible. It's light, and super portable and goes everywhere with me.",2,2
"So fun, I can play all kinds of music and even my fave radio station out of Los angeles. Ask her anything!",2,2
"I love the ability to just say what song I want to hear and Alexa plays it, or stops immediately when I instruct her to. The jokes and pick up lines are a crowd favorite as well.",2,2
"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa",2,2
Seems like a great tablet for my youngest daughter. The parental controls are nice and the battery life seems decent too.,2,2
"My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from",2,2
Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.,2,2
No cheaper reader on the market. Great value. Good product.,2,2
"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",2,2
"I love my Echo. I use it mostly for music but it doesn't everything I need it to! It's also very handy in the kitchen for things like timers, recipes and measurements",2,2
"Very easy setup, takes maybe 10 minutes to connect to wifi, Bluetooth and complete the setup. We don't have a lot of the smart home equipment to really utilize all the Echo's features but works really well for getting weather, news, recipes, playing games and listening to music.",2,2
"Bought this to cut the cable cord! Works better than I imagined, highly recommend it!",2,2
great device so far. still learning new features on it daily,2,2
I love it. I enjoy playing games and reading on it.,2,2
"Love my Echo! I brought it home and started playing with it. I had Alexa playing music, setting alarms, getting weather information. I have begun to rely on Alexa for a number of things. So glad I made this purchase.",2,2
I love that I can talk to it and get an answerI have recommended to my sister. now we can send a message to each,2,2
"It should be easier.to print off highlights and have a choice not.to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight.It should be easier to erase ""All"" highlights.Regular book numbers should correlate with location.Easier.to.forward.through chapters.",1,2
My Kindle Fire is much better than my previous Kindle. Works well in bright day light and user friendly. Access to books and downloading is more streamlined with this device. I'd not hesitate to buy again for myself or as a gift.,2,2
Live the ease of use. Recommended for anybody that has Amazon and isn't a fan of goggle.,2,2
I got this for sister's son who is enjoying it so far with the apps and games.,2,2
I bought 2 fires for my children and they were a great purchase. They aren't expensive and they are easy to maunuver through even for kids. They love them.,2,2
Our youngest mostly uses it for games. Easy to navigate,2,2
This is the best tablet I have ever purchased. Very easy to operate,2,2
Love the Fire box! Saves us tons on TV. Love all the Apps.,2,2
"He loves to read, play games and watch movies. Great purchase",2,2
This is my 4th Kindle and my 1st from Best Buy. It was much easier to purchase on line and pick up at the store a short time later.,2,2
Love the kindle product have purchased several kindles and several types and this is another great product. this model doesnt have the auto dimming feature that i like on previous model but still a great kindle,2,2
"I had purchased a tablet for my son as s Christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and I loved it, especially since I have problems with my hands. This tablet proved to be the best thing for me. My experience with Best Buy is the best choice I could make on my tablet. The staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers.",2,2
Great tablet for the price. Good size. Easy to use.,2,2
"Superb value for the price I paid. I can stream video easily, and read ebooks with ease.",2,2
Wish you could choose the response name of your own instead of the ones provided,2,2
i very happy with my tablet i love it and if i ever get a new one it will be bigger love it,2,2
I love my kindle fire I downloaded books easy . Thank god for that !,2,2
Great Speed. Nice Graphics. Really love this Fire.,2,2
"I had the first gen kindle and this is soooo much better. Screen looks better, the front and back camera is cool, the side control buttons are convenient and so far the tablet works great. It was an easy setup and transfer from my Amazon acct. I bought it originally for my 4 yr old so the parental controls are great too.",2,2
Like to have in house. It makes life easier and no need to browse internet,2,2
"The Kindle Voyage is light weight, slim. easy to use and so far has been a good product. The page turns very easily and the light works very well. The anti glare screen is the best!",2,2
I am an old guy and I am having trouble trying to get the unit up and running. I decided I really should return it but it was past the return date. It is back in the box waiting to find time to try one more time or put it on ebay.,0,1
this item is great does not take any space plus has some great features.,2,2
"Hooked up my tv, speakers, lights and cameras to Alexa!",2,2
Great streaming box to watch anything from the internet.,2,2
I'm a big fan of my Amazon Fire Tv. I really enjoy being to access my favor apps on one device.,2,2
My daughters had been talking about the Amazon Echo for a while! I made the decision to purchase them each one for Valentine's Day. They are loving it!,2,2
Works great and holds a charge forever. Looks as if I'm actually reading from paper.,2,2
If you want to save money and cut your cable bill this is the way to go.I am now saving over $80 a month because of all the stations that I get now on Amazon Fire Tv.,2,2
The product works great as of now. It arrived as promised,2,2
This tablet is just the right size.. my baby was ale to use it on plane. But i would recommend a bumper if you buy for kids.,2,2
I have several of these tablets and they are still my favorite compared to my expensive IPad. Best buy ships pretty fast and I am pleased with their online store.,2,2
Wonderful tablet for the kids. It comes in nice colors and has so many nice features.,2,2
Awseome tablet for kids. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.,2,2
Easy to set up and works great with hue lighting!!,2,2
I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day. She isn't the best with technology but this is perfect for her.,2,2
great value at #35 . great for a kids tablet. you dont worry about kids breaking an expensive tablet,2,2
"We bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. The layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. Once you figure it out, it isn't bad. Not an iPad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price.",2,2
"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side.",2,2
I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.,2,2
This product far exceeded my expectations. I've had no issues thus far in regards to video quality.,2,2
"this thing works great. it was simple to set up and has great sound. all of my Amazon prime music is available. we keep it downstairs where we watch tv so it is available. Now we need a ""spot"" for the kitchen. Set a timer, put items on the grocery list Etc.",2,2
"Love the product, but was not aware that I would have to spend $8.00 a month to play most of the music I like to listen to.",2,2
"I bought that for my parents. Great product, easy to operate, they love it. Also great price, thank you, Best buy.",2,2
The sound is really good for a portable speaker. I have 2 dots but use this one in the living room to listen to music.,2,2
This tablet works very well and the price is excellent. I bought for my nephew and he is so happy.,2,2
I am so happy with the Kindlefire. I bought the first generation Kindlefire & I was happy with it. When I bought this new Kindlefire I was happily & surprised at how much better this version is. I use the Kindlefire mainly for watching movies & reading books. So.happy with it :),2,2
nice pickup for my wife who is just learing to use a tablet,2,2
"Don't let the summary fool you; the reason this is the third one is because of the quality! I've bought one for myself, one for my son-in-law, and I bought this as a replacement for my mother, who uses it to read books in her tiny apartment. The Kindle Fire is extremely user-friendly, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but reliable tablet.",2,2
great reader for bed or the beach. definitely a must pack on vacation.,2,2
I like the size! The screen is perfect for my online reading textbooks for school!,2,2
The picture looks better running netflix on this than apple tv.,2,2
Wow what a tablet my girls are have the time of their lives. Hey it was a little learning in the beginning but once they got it the rest was history.,2,2
Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!,2,2
"I was not expecting much with this product, but man I was surprised how well it worked. I added the charter app and I am able to watch live tv on it.",2,2
"I love the Fire Kindle/tablet. This is my 3rd kindle, 2nd Fire. The new Fire is so much easier to use as a tablet plus nothing beats a kindle for reading books. This Fire is much easier to use than my husband's Samsung tablet",2,2
I have a kindle paperwhite 2 before and just updated my machine. The recent machine presents much more clear and reaches 300 ppi. Besides the price is much more welcome,2,2
"I love it, I like to use to relax after coming from job",2,2
I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.,2,2
It's continent for my son but is too slow to connect to wifi,2,2
Features that i never thought I would be interested.,2,2
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet,2,2
Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would.,2,2
Great to have my entire library with me and no I can read in bed with the backlight also.,2,2
Purchased this for my 5 yr old son. I had previously purchased 2 other tablets for him (both different brands) and they both went out within a year. He loves his tablet. He is able to play his ABC mouse and watch Netflix. Easy for him to navigate. I am going to purchase the 16g for myself.,2,2
Bought the fire for both my grandkids. They love being able to surf the web and play games.,2,2
I gave this to my 3 yr old to play games and watch movies. My TV's have been reclaimed!,2,2
It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!,2,2
"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.",2,2
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.,2,2
Great product for the money. My family and I are enjoying it.,2,2
I absolutely love my fire tv. it works so well and offers so many different things to watch. I will never need cable again. it loads fast and I would recommend these to anyone who will listen!,2,2
"Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick.",0,2
it is easy for him to use. It has all the apps. that he wanted and can add more.,2,2
Decent tablet for the price. Economic tablet for easy browsing.,2,2
Really enjoy talking to Alexa. It's great to not have to look up things on the computer and so easy to just ask questions or listen to music,2,2
"I had been looking for something to watch my Amazon Prime and this gives me an easy way to do it plus Netflix, HBO and more. Easy plug and go makes it good to move from room to room easily",2,2
Excellent machine for children. Easy to use and download.,2,2
Capable to run games just as spected and very handly,2,2
I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.,2,2
"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",2,2
"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.",2,2
I am loving my Amazon Fire Tv because it gave me the freedom to only pay for what I watch which was one of the things that really bugged me with cable tv. I used to have hundreds of channels available but also paying hundreds of dollars for them and with the Fire TV I just spend the dollar amount that I want.,2,2
Worked as expected.,2,2
I bought it for my media room it is great!! Faster than the previous version,2,2
easy to use. works great when you have an Amazon account,2,2
"I'm so happy to bought it, i will buy two more soon",2,2
i haven't been able to use it a lot yet. for now only use for music.,2,2
For the money best Bang for your buck....Really great if you subscribe to amazon prime.,2,2
This is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.,2,2
I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.,2,2
Great gift !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,2
This item is one of the sweetest things I have ever brought.,2,2
"Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",0,0
"I bought one Fire TV just to test out ""cutting the cable"" and start streaming TV. I was so impressed with Amazon's Fire TV that I bought a second one for the bedroom. Small, easy to setup, full featured and fast.",2,2
Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.,2,2
Not a big reader but gave it to someone that is. She is happy so I think that should make me happy.time will tell,0,2
These were great gifts for the grandkids!! They were easy for them to use and now they are almost as good as the adults on them!,2,2
"Nice size, very clear video. Lots of great apps! Excellent price.",2,2
"Fire TV is good except I have to reboot it more than should be necessary. It drops its network connection too often. Rather than reentering my password, I find it easier to just unplug it for a few seconds. Once, the remote became unresponsive . The fix: remove the batteries then put them right back in. Updates should correct these matters.",2,0
Meets all advertised items in the software. Easy to down load books and screen quality is very pleasant.,2,2
"With these being on sale for $33, we couldn't pass up the deal. These tabletd are perfect for younger kids.",2,2
"I've had a Kindle since they first came out and was happy to get one with a backlit screen. I like the WiFi and the 3G because I like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. I still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller I am always turning the page. I have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like I'm doing more page turning.",2,2
This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.,2,2
"Love the Fire TV. It is fast and reliable. I have all my movies, tv shows and apps in one place.",2,2
It could be a couple of square inches bigger but its great. Ability to adjust background light is fantastic.,2,2
"Thank you, the Fire works great!! My daughter is on it all the time, and I can regulate what she looks at.",2,2
My son's love these things. Great price and works for me.,2,2
my gesr fit heart monitor was not compatible with android level,0,2
It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.,2,2
Very nice tablet for the price and great for kids.,2,2
Great product the entire family enjoys it. Works without any problems.,2,2
Bought a firestick and the box the same day. The box has larger memory so I don't have to worry about clearing my cache as often.,2,2
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.,2,2
What a great price and very easy to use.Had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though.,2,2
got for a great deal bought 2 for the kids and they love them.,2,2
"Purchased Blue unit - parenthesis below is error correction for that review since BB does not allow edit. Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising/purchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account, (*which is linked to and displays any saved credit card/payment data associated with your account. Not very private or secure in my opinion.*) All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.",1,0
Love my Kindle! It's perfect for my Netflix obsession late at night! Great size and picture quality!,2,2
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.,2,2
"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Best Buy had them on sale so it was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events",2,2
Small enough to carry with me. I love how the pages turn with just a touch to the screen and I love the lit up background.,2,2
"After purchasing 2 different ""brand X"" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price!",2,2
Great speaker but u have to have amazon prime to hear songs @ random was unaware so I gave 4 stars 4 that reason over all great sound,2,2
Very happy with my new tablet. Everything is assessible and easy to find. Great pic quality. My 10 year old loves it and has taken ownership of it which shows how easy it is to use.,2,2
"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",2,2
"Works well, loud, and constant updates.Helpful for home automation products like hue lights.",2,2
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...",1,2
"It was a Wonderful gift for the holidays, I've enjoyed it greatly!!",2,2
"Great item, this is very useful and it is hard to come by.",2,2
Bought this for my younger sister. She's 9 and uses it to stream Netflix and play games. She tells me it's fantastic,2,2
"I LOVE the Amazon Echo, it's everything I expected and more",2,2
Love it! I didn't think I would use it but it turns out I use it all the time!,2,2
The best working tablet under $50 I have ever used.,2,2
"works, that is all that counts",2,2
I don't read the books. I'm still learning about it. I don't really even use it.,1,2
The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.,2,2
"Excellent Tablet for beginners and kids. The cameras and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price. Its not for everyone, you get what you pay for",2,2
Fantastic streaming device with plenty of options. Love the voice controlling remote!,2,2
This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc.,2,2
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).",2,2
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.,2,2
It's work very well for a child got for my 8 year old she love it,2,2
This was a present for my father and he hasn't complained one bit about it.,2,2
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her,2,2
"Great streaming device with a lot of options to watch, highly recommended and super easy to install and use",2,2
Purchased tab for my kids and they love it thus far. They play games on it and it works great.,2,2
"i bought two fire tv boxes and both of them have problems, the problem is that the remote suddenly stops working and then it comes back and works, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start working. That never happen with the roku",0,0
Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.,2,2
Another great product from amzon. My daughter has nothing but great things to say about it.,2,2
Can't believe how much fun we have had with our new echo. Love all the music we can listen too so quickly.,2,2
Since I bought my Echo I have bought 3 others as gifts and at least 10 other people that I showed mine to went and bought one as well.This is a real look into the future of information and control,2,2
"My soul purpose for buying this item was to read which I am completely satisfied for it, howevef, the camera quality isn't of great quality",2,2
It seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger.,2,2
Perfect for emailing and reading books online. Battery lasts a long tine.,2,2
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.,1,2
Love the fact that you can ask questions and get your answer quickly.,2,2
Would have liked more features for the money paid..,2,2
This is the box you want for 4k. If not get the regular stick.,2,2
Very satisfied so far. Easy to use and great price,2,2
"My 2 year old broke the first one. Best buy replaced it with no problems, their warranty is the best.",2,2
Transitioning away from standard tv and this worked great!,2,2
"Love, Love, Love, my hubby absolutely loves his new Kindle fire. Great picture and easy to use.",2,2
Excellent speakers and great voice control... I'm very happy with my alexia,2,2
i have not had any issues with it. i like the separate profiles so i can use it too with out him getting online. plus i can down load a app and if it is suitable for him i can add it to his profile.,2,2
I like it small lightweight easy to see wifi capabilities,1,2
My wife loves it since she is home alone in the day time,2,2
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names.",2,2
Enjoy using my fire tv I have taken it out of town and it hook up just fine,2,2
"Great to use for a daily use, easy to use and light and great to watch movies.",2,2
"This is a great tablet for an affordable price. Has most of the functionality you would get with a high-end tablet with expandable memory. Access your books, browse web, email, etc. Nice screen resolution, no issues with it thus far",2,2
Outstanding I love this device highly recommend it for anybody and everyone user-friendly,2,2
I love my Alexa! I am learning new applications every day.I really like listening to NPR news and to classical music. I have ordered plugs for light control. I am sure I will get into more smart home apps in the future.,2,2
This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.,2,2
My Fire Kindle is wonderful and I use it all the time.,2,2
Bought this for my daughter-in-law she was getting headaches from her last e reader. She loves the light on this paper white.,2,2
"I use it frequently and have enjoyed watching shows. I would have given it a perfect score, but not all of my shows are on it.",2,2
Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.,2,2
Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs,2,2
"Best streaming device out there, very fast and responsive. A bit more than fire stick but very well worth it!",2,2
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.,2,2
This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.,2,2
"Really enjoying this baby kindle! My first experience with a Kindle product. Fits in my purse even in folio. Recommend a stylus. Having fun loading it up with books, videos, music, and apps. Use it for email and facebook, internet searches, etc. I don't have a smart phone so this is really handy. And, hey, it has TWO cameras, too!!! For $50--UNBELIEVABLE!!! At this price, I could have one in every room of my house!",2,2
I love the load up speed there on great and a great way to enjoy netflix,2,2
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but its great for entertainment.",2,2
Works very well as long as you have good internet speed. Saves us a lot of money not paying for satellite.,2,2
Bought it when it was 50 percent off. Good product.,2,2
i am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you BB,2,2
"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience.",2,2
I spend more money taking my family out to dinner for a night than I spent on this wonderful little thing. I picked up a rubber guard and screen protector from another big box retailer and have a perfect tablet for my two-year-old for less than 70 bucks. This tablet has a kids profile mode which makes it perfect for your little one but also all the apps and great Amazon accessibility for the adults. I took a star off for the tiny amount of internal memory which gets used up extremely quickly so I would definitely recommend a micro SD card and making sure you change the settings to store your apps on the card and not be internal memory. Otherwise no complaints and several places on the Internet will tell you how to use another big-name App Store to download your favorites.,2,2
"Good capabilities good sound, quick responses. Good amount of applications which respond quickly.",2,2
Quick and easy to install and simple to use my 6yr old knows how to work it,2,2
I am so glad I purchased these. We can get all of our favorite movies!!!!,2,2
"Always wanted to read more and I am with Kindle Voyage. This version rocks all previous versions. The side lit screen, smooth resolution, ultra lightweight in hand feel, and more make this the kindle that's perfect to me.",2,2
The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.,2,2
"I owned a first generation kindle (that was shaped like a book, with one side wider and heaver to mimic a spine, BTW) when they first came out. Then I owned a kindle 2, which really didn't improve much except on the physical shape and memory. But this one is a huge improvement. Having the back-lit display is completely awesome. I thought I was going to miss a physical keyboard but I definitely don't. If you have a non-backlit kindle, I'd definitely recommend this one. Also, I've played with my friend's Voyager, and I definitely don't think it's worth the extra price for what you get.",2,2
"I had a 7 inch kindle hd tablet. I wanted a larger screen so I purchased the 10 inch kindle. I am very happy with the device. I surf the web, play some games, read books, and process my email.",2,2
"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry.",2,2
Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.,2,2
Perfect for my house. Its a space saver for me plus its various features just are value adds to my reading.,2,2
Great eReader for the price. Amazon Prime member. I use eReader when I travel.,2,2
This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.,2,0
I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think. The screen and sound quality isn't super HD but it's acceptable.,2,0
couldn't go wrong with the amazon tablet for $50 best deal there is only at Best Buy!,2,2
I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products,2,2
Great value. My kids love it and use it often. Really helps them with homework.,2,2
The only thing that I didn't like was that I had to sign up with Amazon Prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. I ended up paying a little bit more.,1,2
"This is a great buy - and especially for the price. Use it every day. Screen is great, features good. Highly recommend it.",2,2
I absolutely love the Echo. It works great with home automation devices. I love how I can use it with Pandora.,2,2
Love it ... need to get some smart appliances! I also got the Echo dot - wish I got these items sooner,2,2
"Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable.",2,2
Perfect I love it glad I did my homework before purchasing best choice for a reader,2,2
I had a non-background light kindle before. Now I replace it with the Kindle paperwhite. Good as expected.,2,2
I love my Echo that I received for Christmas from my wife that I bought it for my son in law for his birthday. He has Amazon prime so he can do much more with the Echo. I will be subscribing also.,2,2
I love this box. Better than the firestick by far.,2,2
I have purchased the fire stick in the past. Now the box does everything the stick does and I can expand the memory which is a huge plus for me. Also being able to plug directly into a cat5 cable helps with streaming..,2,2
Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.,2,2
I was a little hesitant in buying a kindle. I thought it would take away the feeling of reading a hard cover book. I love the kindle. I don't regret buying it. I love that I can store all my books on this device.,2,2
I purchased a blue and orange one for each of my twin boys. Their bday is on Aug 22. I have not yet gave them the kindle. But I downloading quite a few games before giving it to them. The graphics are amazing. If all goes well i'm thinking about buying the purple one for myself.,2,2
It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy,2,2
Great for reading!I only wish it could be larger and more compatible with pdf files,2,2
"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire",2,2
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.,2,2
"I purchased this for my dad.He is 84 years and enjoys having her play music for him, tell him the weather and even helps control lighting. He loves her jokes and her witty come backs. She is his virtual pet.",2,2
Easy to use. Lightweight... can easily read in low light / night.,2,2
"This was sold out on Amazon prior to Christmas, and my spouse really wanted one. This was ordered and delivered sooner than expected, in plenty of time for Christmas. She loves it and uses it several hours each day. Much better vehicle for her use rather than the cell phone. Cruises the web, stays in-touch with family, and dreams! Great service from Best Buy, great product as well.",2,2
Got it so I can have everything in one device and it does that flawless. It's very fast and responsive and the voice search is really good,2,2
Bought for Friends Anniversary they love it the first one was damaged no hassle return,2,2
so far I'm enjoying my wireless headphones and sounds great,2,2
If you are fan of iOS and iPad then you will not like this product. I prefer to give it to either kids who want to play and watch videos or people who loves to read( only if they Amazon prime account).,1,2
"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader.",2,2
"This is my 2nd Kindle. I love the ability to read anywhere no matter the light, especially at night. I don't disturb anyone with a light if I am having trouble sleeping.",2,2
"You have to purchase the power outlets, light switches, and other things for Alexa to communicate with. Once you do and setup them up, it works pretty well. You have to be careful if you put it near the TV where they might do a commercial or a story about it on the news, Alexa has pretty good hearing and perks up when she hears her name. Over all, easy to set up with the app and works pretty well. Takes some time getting used to asking Alexa to turn on or off the lights and not just reaching for the light switch.",2,2
"I didn't like that this model came with a USB cable but not a plug. Other than that, it met my expectations. Synching the new device with my existing Kindle account was easy. And my initial fear that the touchscreen would collect fingerprints and dirt hasn't been a problem so far.",2,0
Great tablet. Love everything about it. Good selection of apps for free. If you decide to buy apps is also worth it. Cheap prices,2,2
"I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee.",2,2
I am enjoying taking the Kindle with me when I am traveling and also just resting in bed before falling asleep.,2,2
Was able to hook it up in minutes. Emailed Amazon with a question and received an answer back within a day.,2,2
I got it because a frend that really lime it. I had apple tv and still think is better than this,1,2
Was looking for something decent and inexpensive for my niece. Got this for Black Friday and so far it's been great. Internal memory doesn't worry me because it will mostly be used for streaming apps like Youtube and Netflix. I wish the UI would be better but overall the tablet is good enough for what i bought it for.,2,2
I have had my Kindle Paperwhite for over a month now and I absolutely love it. The screen adjustment to match the room lighting is great and it is much faster and responsive than the older Kindle my wife has. It is so lightweight and comfortable to hold. One of the best parts is the battery last for weeks even with heavy use.,2,2
"This is my third Echo. The secret is the array of microphones. It hears you over music and in your natural speaking voice. Very helpful and a good speaker. Easiest way ever to connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker. ""Alexa, Bluetooth connect,"" and you are done.",2,2
Enjoying the kindle fire!!! Great for kids to use!!,2,2
"Originally figured this would be almost a toy, but as I easily started connecting the Echo to my existing home automation components I realized this would become a key part of my home. Throw in the different connections the Echo can make (with my car, for example) and you now have an essential component to your day...absolutely worth it!",2,2
Easy to download apps and nice to watch movies and my daughter loves it,1,2
It was very easy to use. My grandma was able to figure it out with no problem,2,2
"For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended",2,2
This was a great Christmas gift. the price was great and the amazon fire is small enough to bring with to travel .,2,2
"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8.",2,2
I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.,2,2
Awesome device! Turns your tv into a smart tv. Really no need for cable anymore.,2,2
"I am definitely happy with my purchase. It's a very good android box, even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload (install other android apps not from the amazon store) this makes one of the top android boxes. Also the ability to play some games makes it a plus. (just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to 8GB on this box)",2,2
Really neat tool. We bought it for a neighbor and he is excited to have it.,2,2
"I love it! Not only is it good for listening to music, it's great for asking questions too. I love being able to ask how my commute will be!Alexa is always gaining new skills too. Now it works with my home automation system!",2,2
"Can do everything the regular kindles can do, but in full color. My Wife loves it and is always reading magazines and watching movies.",2,2
Great price. Great product. Best product for the money.,2,2
"There are many apps for the fire box, and there are many uses. The picture is very crisp and set up in a breeze.",2,2
Bought after seeing my son's echo while on a visit. My wife loved it so bought her one upon our return home.,2,2
Very easy to set up and the whole family is have alot of fun with this great product!!!,2,2
"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!",2,2
"A must-have if you have any Kindle or Fire products! This definitely charges things much faster, and is great to have in several locations for convenience, especially if people tend to borrow your chargers.",2,2
The first thought came into my mind after getting Kindle Paperwhite that why I didn't buy this thing earlier! It is an awesome device. I really didn't think that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book. Highly recommended.,2,2
"Good purchase, suits our needs at a reasonable price.",2,2
This device is fun with all the different apps you can use. Great speaker quality too.,2,2
"This is so perfect for reading. If you only want it for reading, then I would most definitely get this. I can read for hours on it, in light and in the dark. It's super easy to buy books and download books. Favorite Christmas purchase!",2,2
My wife saw the Echo at a friend's house and could not stop talking about it. It's a neat device especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and can link your music files. The kids have fun asking questions or finding out the weather each morning but it's use seems pretty limited to me other than being a fun product.,2,2
"Works great, but don't like how you have to spell everything out.",1,2
As a lover of books I love the portability and battery life of this. Definitely would recommend to anyone.,2,2
I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.,2,2
bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....,2,2
"Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big.",2,0
"I purchased the Fire tv box and it just stopped working one day. Wont boot, just sits at the logo. I spoke to customer service who could care less. They said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired. Its not like I bought this in 2012. Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon. I am on my way to buy an Nvidia Shield TV for my streaming needs. BTW it doesnt have an Amazon app (wink). This is the first box I have ever owned that just stopped working.",0,0
Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.,2,2
"I want one in every room, this is so handy. I love love love it!!",2,2
"I like the tablet. It works really well. I ended up purchasing two, a black one for my wife and I to use and a blue one for our toddler son. So far so good. I did get free virus software with the tablet as part of a black Friday deal but it doesn't seem compatible with the Amazon Fire although it's supposed to be. Thus far that's the only downside.",2,2
"I use the echo for shopping list, answers to questions, music and much more. I love Alexa and would not trade her for anything!",2,2
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!",2,2
I have no idea why someone would need to pay hundreds for a tablet when they can just get a fire.,2,2
This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle,2,2
I bought this to download videos to watch while going on a long road trip. It worked perfect for that.,2,2
Bought this for my 84 year old mother who is an avid reader. So easy to use! She enjoys the lightweightness of the Kindle paperwhite and the non glare screen. She is able to adjust the font for enjoyable reading sized material and enjoys the LED's for reading at bedtime. Kindle paperwhite is definitely a gift that keeps giving and keeps mom smiling too!,2,2
I picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working. I like the back lite and it's not a bad size.,2,2
Easy setup and seamless streaming. Would like to see Amazon upgrade this item to 4K.,2,2
"Easy and convenient for my grandchildren, they really enjoy it",2,2
This echo simplifies my daily life activities and is worth every penny.,2,2
"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.",0,2
Great basic tablet for kids and novices. Worth a try,2,2
My son loves his Kindle for games and he loves it for reading.,2,2
This Protective Case was just right for my Kindle.,2,2
So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.,2,2
Pretty comparable to the other streaming devices I own other than the obvious Amazon geared menu.,2,2
"the screen is mediocre. the processor is good, very little storage. and you have to deal with ads, every time you turn on the screen. You can pay to have them removed. for that price you can get a better screen, more storage and open ecocistem. that is not tied only to amazon",1,2
It's a great working machine fast speed streaming. You are able to install external apps and get a lot of shows all in all I'm very satisfied with this device,2,2
I bought this in thanksgiving day. It's good for the price !!,2,2
Love this. Easy to use. Love that you can purchase external memory card for this tablet. I am excited to say I purchased 5 of these for family members and I am happy with the tablet.,2,2
I really like the kindle. It so much easier to care around to read.,2,2
I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed,2,2
"This is the 6th tablet I have purchased. The Kindle Fire tablets are perfect for just about everyone; from my 2 year old grandson to my mother. I purchased this one for my mother, by the way. For her, I thought she could easily access her email and play mind challenging games. WiFi is need to use this, which is great because there are no monthly charges for using this tablet. Also, it must be set up very securely because no security system is needed.",2,2
Best Christmas Gift ever to my Mom that doesn't use a computer,2,2
"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!",2,2
"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.",2,2
use it everyday. enjoy reading using the Kindle Fire HD 10.,2,2
Excellent Product & Highly recommended. Excellent!,2,2
"Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras.",2,2
We are enjoying Alexa a lot! she is funny at times,2,2
The display is not great but can be used as a back up device for rough use,2,2
I have purchased a few of these items they are perfect for getting rid of tv,2,2
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho,1,2
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.,2,2
"I Love my new kindle! Is perfect, this model is The best",2,2
"I purchased for Christmas gifts, kids are loving so far!",2,2
"Bought for my daughter, she loves it, uses it for music mainly.",2,2
I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.,2,2
"This was purchased to replace the fire stick. If you're debating between the fire stick and the fire TV, get the fire tv box. Waiting for the fire stick to power on and connect to wifi, or trying to type anything with a directional pad wastes too much time!",2,2
"Can't beat the price, awesome for kids and doesn't break the bank.",2,2
This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.,2,2
"Overall it is hard to say this is a good Tablet just looking at it in a vacuum. That being said when you take the price into consideration, it is hard to say it's not a good value. The screen isn't very bright so outdoor use is difficult ( I wanted to use it as a screen for my drone but its not ideal), and it's locked down by the Amazon Echo System. It does work and it doesnt hiccup or struggle too much and again for the value especialyl when I bought it for $33 its hard to argue. It can also be hacked to install the Play Store on it which makes it even more of a value.",2,0
"Bought on Black Friday, couldn't complain about the price. I bought 3. One for myself, one for my mom and one for my 4yr old step daughter. My mom loves the large font option. I love being able to browse the Web and watch netflix. My little one loves to play games on, thank goodness for the kid option! Don't have to worry about to going to non-kid-friendly apps/websites.",2,2
The Kindle was purchased for my daughter. She loves it. She plays games on it everyday.,2,2
I am really impressed with Amazon box. The processor is really fast and responsive. Has one of the better remotes out there.,2,2
This is great technology. I can even order from it.,2,2
"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all",2,2
The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.,2,2
I really love the kindle. Great for the price. And u can add a memory card for more storage.,2,2
I bought this tablet originally for my kids but I loved it so much I had to purchase one for myself. Love it!!,2,2
Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal,2,2
I really love the tablets I brought it for my younger kids,2,2
This is a good tablet for someone just wanting to surf the internet. Would buy again if was only surfing.,1,2
"Bought this to replace xfinity cable tv with playstation vue. the quality of the picture is excellent and with all of the others apps, music, and movies from amazon prime you absolutely cannot beat this product. i highly recommend.",2,2
So far has done essentially thing I have asked of it. It has so many more capabilities so I have just scratched the surface but I very happy. Only rating a 4 because I have not utilized to its full potential. Will be buying three more next month for employees.,2,2
This is my grandson's 2nd kindle fire! Great product and great price!,2,2
"I've always used AppleTV but now that I've started using this, I got to it before my Apple TV. More options to choose from. And I can still cast my MacBook to it! (Gotta install an app though) but I like it.",2,2
This is a great product at a great price! They will make great first time tablets for kids.,2,2
I tried the Roku but the Fire TV was just more flexible and the menu was easier to navigate.,2,2
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful,2,2
It is very easy to use and i love that it syncs with my phone app for holding my reading spot.,2,2
"Nothing special. It is a pretty good speaker for the money, but it's not that useful for much else. My Apple TV does more for home automation and entertainment.",1,2
"I would recommend this to anyone. It's an absolutely amazing product. So light, the auto brightness is great and it's convenient to carry around with you.",2,2
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",2,2
Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.,2,2
My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy,2,2
"Easy to setup, battery lasts for as long as needed. You can do all the basics that a higher end tablet does and is reasonably priced..",2,2
"We purchased this device when we switched from cable to PlayStation Vue. It works great for that, but we have found we also enjoy watching Amazon movies and listening to Amazon music as well. If you're an Amazon prime member this is a no-brainer. We also enjoy that it is simple for our 9 and 10 year old children to use.",2,2
I bought this tablet for my son. i really liked the price compared to other brands.,2,2
"I really like my kindle. It is so gentle on my eyes. I don't have to charge it as often either. Lots of great features, highlighting especially is useful as it saves it to a new ' my clippings' file.",2,2
The speaker is great and the microphone is good but overall works just as needed.,2,2
I have a 2014 Kindle HDX and I brought two of these. One for my daughter and one for my husband. I love the new features. I will be buying one for me in the very near future. Great inexpensive price Amazon !!! Thank you for showing that better doesn't have to be extremely pricey. I also love the fact that you added a memory slot. Added 64GB to both. Thank you. Highly recommended!,2,2
very good product and service will refer a friend.,2,2
I really enjoy the Echo and the power of Alexa. There are so many different skills that is has something for everyone and while it is used for home automation there are many things you can do with it if you don't have any other connected home devices. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that the speaker quality could be a little better for music. I competes in quality with bluetooth products in the $100-$150 range but systems like the Bose sound link mini are still superior in sound quality.,2,2
This is an amazing product. Enjoying it very much.,2,2
"This thing is great she has a response for everything. I love it, music, quotes, jokes, time and weatger, a real one stop shop.",2,2
this is an excellent product provide a great picture,2,2
The fire tv has been a great addition to my entertainment system! The customer service was great! My sales associate helped me make a decision by having all the information i needed! This is an example of why i remain a loyal customer.,2,2
Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings,2,2
.. I bought four of these tablets two of them I need to return because as soon as my nephew's turn them on there were problems with screen being almost completely white and black in the corners you can't see anything I've checked the settings it's not the city it's the tablet SMH I am disappointed,0,0
Last minute online purchase before taking my daughter on a trip. It was ready for pick up in an hour and kept her entertained the entire ride.,2,2
"Easy to setup and use for basic everyday use. Haven't gotten into lights and more advanced uses, but all in all very satisfied for the price",2,2
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!",2,2
"Very easy set up. Sound is great, looking foward to use all.its features!",2,2
"Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it",2,2
The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!,2,2
Does everything I thought it would do and then some. Bought one for my daughter and a friend too.,2,2
These box is amazing!!! A must if you have Amazon Prime.,2,2
Been in my wish list for long time and purchased this recently. Was worth a purchase,2,2
"I wanted to upgrade my 3rd gen kindle keyboard to one with a backlight. The paper white is a great device to read on. The backlight and improved screen resolution make a big difference. There's a few software features I'd like Amazon to add but nothing that inhibits me from using the kindle. If you've been thinking of upgrading or jumping into the kindle for the first time, I'd highly recommend the paper white.",2,2
"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading",2,2
Left my first reader on the airplane. Rushed right down to replace it. Had a nook before and my wife had a kindle. I finally had to admit she made the better choice.,2,2
Wi-Fi works great lots of options for viewing and works quick. Small so fits behind TV and does not need to be indirect site for remote,2,2
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough.",2,2
"This is our second full size Echo and I love it. It is a great device overall, and when combined with other smart home products it really comes to life. I highly recommend one to anyone that is curious about the features or the potential uses in home automation.",2,2
"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business.",0,0
The Amazon Fire TV is the way to go! Very easy to set up and use!!! A++,2,2
"This is my first e-reader. The screen has a nice feel to it. It reads really well. I don't like the fact that Amazon has total control of your purchases. I do not like the Amazon free unlimited book trial. They don't allow access to certain titles. So far I am able to find most of my book selections. I will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from Amazon. The battery life seams to be awesome. Of course when you shut it off ads pop up. The kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. But they seem to mysteriously change on their own (even when it is turned off) Strange. It is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one. (Kindle Paperwhite) I like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse, yet big enough to read...the font is adjustable too, if you need bigger letters.",2,2
Had a nook before I love my new Kindle . It's so much easier to use,2,2
"I have purchased numerous kindles and Fire tablets for family and friends. They've all loved them. When they went on sale at Christmas, I decided it was time to get myself one, after, of course, buying three for unsuspecting niece and nephews. I have an older iPad that I love and use but it is limited due to upgraded technology. This Fire tablet is perfect to do all the things I could not do elsewhere. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you owe it to yourself to get one of these things.",2,2
"Amazing how low cost this tablet is. Good for basic apps and browsing. Has ads on the lock screen unless you pay to get rid of them, but is just the lock screen and does not interfere with any functionality. For cost can't go wrong.",2,2
This is a great device and my whole family loves it!,2,2
The set up was quick and simple. The voice commands work well.,2,2
"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.",2,2
"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",2,2
Very pleased with the Kindle Fire. Great price too!,2,2
I have one of the first kindles and had to use a attached light if I read at night. This paperwhite is perfect for that as well as the perfect size. I absolutely love it!!,2,2
Easy to set up and use. Love it for streaming you tube and other apps. Voice command is awesome!,2,2
I got 2 for my kids for Xmas and there working real good they love them and I love the price better then eBay ones that would only work for some time then will stop charging,2,2
Grandma loves it..plays her games and keeps up with the grandkids.,2,2
"Love the Amazon Echo, a great addition to the family",2,2
What a difference it makes to read from the paperwhite instead of iphone!,2,2
We love Alexa!! We play music and the quality is outstanding.,2,2
I enjoy the ease i using the item and the case is perfect,2,2
Works great once you get the hang of it. Overall happy with it,2,2
Love it and would probably be just okay using the Fire Stick. Don't need all of the extra storage space and the capability of 4K res (Only beneficial if you have a 4K TV).,2,2
I have bought a kindle paperwhite as a gift for three people and each has LOVED it. It's a reliable reader with a LONG battery life and a great little traveler. I highly recommend it.,2,2
"Very easy to set up. Bought it so I could get Directv Now. Wired and wireless connections were used. Now I can watch tv, Netflix, Youtube, all with the same device.",2,2
Really enjoy my echo. Great sound fun to use and stylist,2,2
I got this as a gift to my inlaws. This is very handy and easy to use. They love it so much,2,2
Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.,2,2
Debated to get Google instead but since we have a Prime subscription it made more sense to go with the Echo. Hope to soon control thermostats and lights.,2,2
The tablet is great for what is being used for gan,2,2
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was,2,2
"Everyone should own an Amazon Echo. My Echo is like having someone that does exactly what you ask quickly without having to think about it or give you any back talk :). I love my Amazon Echo! This is beyond anything I've used in the past. I find myself relying on it more than I do any other device in my house. The entire family enjoys it. We are planning to purchase a couple more to have on each floor of the house. We love it! If you have been thinking about buying one and haven't, you should pick one up today. You'll be glad you did! A great device/friend the entire family will enjoy! By the way, ordering fast food delivery is one of my family's favorite ask! :)",2,2
Excellent product blows away google. It's the way of the future. Try it out,2,2
"I like the tablet but, I don't like all the ads...",2,2
The fire tv has every app that is needed. And it is very easy to install and setup. Probably going to pick up one more!,2,2
Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though,2,2
"After my grand kids fighting over my wife's Kindle in the car, we decided to get them each one for trips. Good first tablet",2,2
My wife loves her Kindke and at this price it was a no brainer. It's fast with a ton of expandable memory storage.,2,2
Very entertaining and helpful! Kids enjoy it as much as us adults do!,2,2
amazing device with useful features. Adds/updates amazon cart so fast and even checking out is fairly simple,2,2
"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",2,2
I very Much enjoy Alexa. A lot of fun. Very helpful. Excellent gift,2,2
One of the best purchases I've ever made! It's ties into my whole home network and works with all of my phone and other products.,2,2
Amazon Fire tablet is one of a kind!! Very easy to use and adaptable to fit all needs!,2,2
"Good tablet for the price. Typically when you pay a small price for a tablet you get a piece of junk, but not this tablet. Its great.",2,2
great starter tablet for any 2nd grader on up great price,2,2
Can be educational and lots of fun too. A variety of uses for Alexa.,2,2
Wanted to replace my fire stick and it was on sale,2,2
"My first e-reader so I cannot compare it to anything else, but this Kindle Voyage exceeded my expectations. Wonderfully clear screen, lightweight,with excellent controls. I purchased mine during a sale, but it is expensive for an e-reader. Highly recommended.",2,2
"Like most, I love reading actual books that I can feel in my hand and turn the physical pages of. Due to that thinking, I spent years not really considering a Kindle. All I can say is that I wish I had one years ago!! It's incredibly easy to read on, and so handy to have. I load up tons of books, which take up no space, and am all set. And I love that I can read before bed without having to leave the light on. Having a Kindle has reinvigorated my love of reading, and I'm reading more than I have in the last few years. Cannot recommend this enough.",2,2
"After dropping by the local store several times and finding they were out of stock, I found one on the shelf!Great product, easy set-up and works great. KODI installed without any issues.",2,2
"This product is fun, but it does not understand a lot of your questions. It is not a user friend item. So it is limited to very few things it can do. For the money, it needs a lot of work. I was expecting more. But it is a toy to have.",1,2
Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,1,2
Exactly what hubby wanted for reading. Likes it better than iPad for reading,2,2
Great sounding Bluetooth speaker and Alexa is very helpful too.,2,2
I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it.He reads lots of books and does some web surfing. I am very pleased with this purchase.,2,2
"I was skeptical about buying the Fire at first because I didn't think I'd like it as much as a good old fashioned book, but books are expensive if you read as much and as fast as I do, so I caved and bought it. I am in love! It's super light weight and easy to navigate and I love that it has night settings to protect your eyes from the screen brightness. You also can use all of your social media and other apps on the tablet which is a major plus.",2,2
This is the best device for watching Netflix content.,2,2
This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!,2,2
"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones.",2,2
"I am upgrading from a gen. 1. I love that I can add a mini SD for more storage, also a lot easier to navigate. My son now has my old one for reading books.",2,2
I needed an extra charger for our cabin so that we would not have to pack one back and forth. Arrived just in time and on time that I got it in time for our next trip over. Works like the original.,2,2
Every day Alexa grows smarter and my music pick just grows with any mood I want to hear . I love that more apps are coming for this product,2,2
Hands down this is the best ereader that you can buy...,2,2
I would highly recommend this product for the money,2,2
This tablet is great for the young kids gift ideas.,2,2
Love my fire tv so easy to use gives me all my services in one place,2,2
"The sound quality is amazing. Echo is now part of the family. It's an alarm clock, cooking timer, music player etc.",2,2
As d scribed,2,2
"Does everything I need really well. I do both of my email accounts, read all of the news and sports I want, and do light research. It's plenty fast and the screen resolution is just fine. Amazing for the price.",2,2
Bought for my Grandparents for Christmas and loaded games for them they love it.,2,2
"Nice 7 "" screen for less than 50.0. Bought 3Gave to relatives . They love them",2,2
I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.,2,2
"This tablet was for my daughters birthday and so far , it's holding up well. She loves it and it does what it was meant ro do. The only drawback is the the screen doesn't get bright like your iphone or Samsung tablets.",2,2
"My wife had an older Kindle but this one had so many improvements: great paper white reading appearance, longer battery life, and it lights up so she can read in bed.",2,2
I have the Firestick and wanted something for another TV. Went with the Fire TV. This was worth the extra money. Just works so much better. Faster and less buffering.,2,2
"This was purchased to replace my 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard. The backlight is a great feature and even though I miss having page turn buttons, it was worth the cost savings to forego them.",2,2
"Hands down you can't go wrong with this tablet. Especially if its on sale and lower than the normal $50 retail price. Sure some google apps might not be in the market place, but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for Netflix or Hulu this tablet would do just fine.",2,0
A single list is easy. We haven't been able to have multiple lists simultaneously. Simple questions can be answered but more complex ones get rejected or mis-answered. The ability to interpret and hear voices is very good with a long range.,2,2
The paper white had excellent lighting regardless of the light in the room. Great long battery life as well.,2,2
It's different than android system's. And to be honest I prefer android.,1,2
"enjoy this product, very easy to use and update when needed",2,2
"Fire , it does the job I wanted it to and that is to entertain my kid and myself. Nothing fancy and it does have it's quirks and bugs. Sometimes can be frustrating on response time with touch screen and loading.",2,2
"If you are going to be using this allot I recommend the Fire TV over the Stick, it is much more responsive. The fire stick tends to be a bit laggy when navigating and launching apps.",2,2
Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.,2,2
Excellent quality and super easy to use. I love that you can expand the memory. Can't beat it for the price!!,2,2
I LOVE THIS THING. HOW DID WE LIVE WITH OUT IT BEFORE HAND! Such and amazing product,2,2
Been a Kindle fan since 1.0. Keeps getting better. I thought the original Paperwhite was perfect however the extra storage and speed are needed and a welcome addition.,2,2
Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.,2,2
The perfect reader you need if you choose to read everywhere,2,2
"Wanted to buy a reliable and cost effective tablet. Was afraid the screen might be too small. Dad loved it. He is 70 and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the Internet, use Skype and listen to music. He is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card. :)",2,2
"The words on the screen are very clear. If a hardcopy book's type is too small I can read it on kindle because I can make the size bigger. Read many positive reviews of the ease of use, page turner, special functions and clear display that I was convinced to buy the kindle voyage",2,2
"If you stream everyday, it is worth the investment for the 4k box vs the fire stick. More powerful, more storage, more time to watch with less loading times.",2,2
I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.,2,2
This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.,0,0
This is a great tablet! It has lots of features. The cost is really low for such a great tablet.,2,2
Great box and fast for steaming and videos good for sports,2,2
Amazing! Cheap! Easy! Fast! The best all in one media device ever created!,2,2
"The tablet doesn't have the best specs, but it was cheap and for my 3 year old. Great product so far!",2,2
I bought for my grand child. She loves it uses it a lot,2,2
The new Kindle Fire's price point is amazing. At $50 this tablet is a full-featured device that is practically disposable.,2,2
"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books.",2,2
Great for road trips and bright enough to read with by the pool.,2,2
"I used to have a old version of kindle, and this one is a great improvement, the resolution is great and the backlight is especially convenient",2,2
So far no problems except no kid friendly case for tablet.,2,2
Does the job. Not often needed as the charge on the kindle lasts so long..,2,2
good item,2,2
"Great Device! Quick, easy to use and a great value!",2,2
"you can read in any light. nice, especially at night when you don't want to disturb anyone. even outside in the daylight",2,2
"I've had the Apple TV, Cromecast, and Amazon Fire and Amazon has the most options that fit what I watch and use not to mention it has the best HD quality I highly recommend it",2,2
Responsive to voice. Has good quality sound. Wish it was wireless!,2,2
"The Good:Great for music playing, and lighting control if you've bought Hue lights, or smart switches. I have the WeMo switches and they work pretty wellGreat for some control of Amazon's Fire stick TV.OK at answering general questions, but not amazing. Alexa is often stumped...Still... its's pretty cool to speak, and have your house react around you...",2,2
I needed to replace my old Kindle reader. This gave me an inexpensive reader and a tablet. Screen quality is not as sharp as HD and contrast is not as good as I'd like. BUT it is a great deal and meets the need.,2,2
"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing.",2,2
"I bought this reader for a trip I was planning. I must say, it is awesome! The size is just perfect to throw in a backpack and the resolution is very good for this pricepoint. You can't go wrong purchasing this!",2,2
Alexa is great and performs well. Biggest issues are Bing is a horrible search engine and is inevitably wrong vs Google. Many times it doesn't understand the question or gives wrong answers while OK google gives much better repossess. Also Amazon music is somewhat limited. Should allow ability to play Sonos or iTunes libraries.,1,2
"Great but needs more work to be worth the money. Very limited in what can be asked in a form of questions. You have to continually down load skills in order to ask questions related to topics this is very taxing and spending time doing it makes you just say, ""forget it"". Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Really should have purchased the Google one but oh well.....",2,2
Great for games and information on daily events and weather,2,2
"Best Reader ever. I've had a lot of Readers like Paper white 2013, Kindle DX, B&N nook and Kobo Aura HD before I get Kindle Voyage. But this one is really different.The only feature that I wish it'd support is memory slot! I guess Amazon will add it to the next generation of Kindles as well as Kindle Fires...",2,2
"For the money it can do a lot, only downside is for the price to be so cheap it is pre-loaded with a LOT of stuff you don't want.",2,2
"I bought three for my each of my grandchildren. They are 2,5,and 7. The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it.",2,2
"I love my echo, it doe everything they say it does. I love listening to my music on my echo the speakers are really good.",2,2
Purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two years old. He loved it!. But the power cord and the tablet hook up didn't work very long. I will be taking it back for a replacement. As long as the connection stays snug it's a great tablet.,2,2
Great addition to our home entertainment setup. Connected up with HDMI and was working within minutes.,2,2
"I bought this for my four year old. I haven't given it to him yet, but I'm impressed how easy it is to use and how many apps are available for his age!",2,2
The Kindle Fire is FABULOUS! I have kids ages 4 to 16 that utilize these devices every day so they get lots of use and wear and tear. We haven't had any problems and Amazon customer service is top notch.,2,2
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids,2,2
Purchased this tablet for my nephew and it's amazing.,2,2
"Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).",2,0
Love the Kindle. Easy to travel with and can be used as a tablet or reader.,2,2
this is such a nice tech thing even the kids can operate and nice for the Google challenge,2,2
"This Amazon Echo might be similar to that of Siri and Google, however, it makes it fun to be able to ask it questions no matter where you are at in the room. It gives precise weather updates, interesting traffic details, and even knowledgeable history lessons each morning. With endless possibilities, this Amazon Echo is a step towards more interesting things to come.",2,2
Easy to install. Super easy for everyone to use. Can't imagine tv without it!,2,2
The fire does a ton and costs very little. I really like it,2,2
My Fire TV has it so much easier moving away from cable.,2,2
"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!",0,0
After two broken iPad screens we switched to this fire tablet for our daughter. It's been amazing. So much more durable and amazon games have actually free where it includes in app purchases.,2,2
This is an amazing product. Got it for my dorm and I love it.,2,2
"I only wish I knew how to use it to its potential, it is capable of so much more.",2,2
Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.,2,2
Bought this to use Play Station Vue to replace Comcast cable. Cheaper and provides all the cable channels we usually watch. Seems to work great - glad I did it!,2,2
Echo has a great speaker for sound and easy to program for music and radio stations Great product easy to use. Get daily news weather set alarm clock etc.,2,2
"I bought this on Black Friday because of the $35 price. I wanted one since I enjoyed using my wife's. This one is a little smaller than hers, but it works wonderful. I have a lot of books downloaded & about 5 games. It has 8gb of memory so it can't handle a ton of games. It can handle those no problem. I really enjoy reading on this before bed and when I need to pass time.",2,2
"Much lighter than my last Kindle, I love it. Great value for the price.",2,2
Alexa isn't as smart as I thought she would be but is pretty good.,2,2
"All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better.",2,2
"Turned older TV into a smart TV. I wish a hdmi cable would of came with fire stick, as it does the cheaper fire stick.",2,2
"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games.",2,1
"An easy way to read your favorite books!Whether you're in the sun or in the dark, this is the best Kindle ever.The only thing I don't like is the 'flash' when you turn the page.",2,2
"The paperwhite model has a very clear screen and backlight so I can be used in most lighting conditions. The manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of. My only complaint is that it includes a USB cable but does not include a charger in the box. Luckily I had a number of appropriate chargers that work well with the reader. Compared to the more expensive models, the Paperwhite had the functionality that I was looking for at a reasonable price.",2,2
"Great tablet for kids. Also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside.",2,2
"I have the fire stick and the fire tv box, I got the box because it allows you to pair a Bluetooth headset so you can listen to your shows at night without waking anyone up, problem is there is interference between wifi and Bluetooth and so listening with headphones gets very choppy, have to connect box thru Ethernet to fix problem.",2,2
Excellent tablet both for reading books and for going to the web,2,2
"I really liked it, even though I purchased for my grand daughters. I have a 6 HD Fire, but I liked this one better. With the expansion slot for space",2,2
However it seems their life is about 3 years. Wish it was longer,2,2
"I ended up getting this Fire for $35 on Black Friday for my youngest son. Great price and great product, easy to use and set up.",2,2
"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far.",1,0
"I Love Love my Fire, you get way more than you expect from this Fire Tablet, Plug into speakers GREAT Sound, Reading screens are wonderful with the ability to use Night time light, Takes amazing photo's and videos, with good quality sound, SMS access is so easy and you can even receive calls, All search engines are accessble. I am getting My little grandkids each one of these with the great tablet protecter. This tablet is Kid friendly and as a parent you can control EVERYTHING they see. Price is amazing and you get way more than you would expect from a tablet that is so affordable.",2,2
"I always liked reading books in physical form, but it just got to hard to carry around. Plus, my bookshelf was too full. This solves both problems!",2,2
bought this tablet for a great price and would recomend it,2,2
"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies.",2,2
"I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value.",2,2
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature,2,2
I mainly use my Kindle strictly for book reading. It's the second one I've owned. The first one I had for several years but quit taking a charge. The device is easy to use and has good battery life.,2,2
Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money.,2,2
muy bueno,2,2
"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating.",2,2
I brought this tablet for my son for Christmas and he loves it. I would definitely recommend this tablet as a starter tablet for younger kids.,2,2
"Paperwhite feature is perfect for intended uses. Outside, on the beach, at night.",2,2
love the fire tv.. super fast uploads. Small and compact,2,2
I love that this tablet has a variety of apps that can be easily be taken to places,2,2
"I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day.",2,2
A Must Have!! Super helpful and convenient. Big time saver and all around fun!!,2,2
This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.,2,2
"I Love my echo. I use my echo for just about everything. I've set up my lights, my tv, I also ask it several questions almost every day. My wife uses it to get cooking measurements. I play music and games as well.",2,2
This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.,2,2
Alexa is always there to answer questions aboutjust about anything and seems to keep learning.will get fire tv soon as a roku died on me and alexacan work it for me,2,2
Great device. This could seriously make me ditch any cable service.,2,2
My father was visiting and broke his tablet and I able able to pick this up in the store the same day.,2,2
It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs.,2,2
It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.,2,2
good for the 7 year old grandson to use easy parental controls,2,2
My wife generally does not like technology gifts. We now have several items in our house connected to our Echo including light bulbs (sold separately).Overall - lots of functionality with the echo. This includes trivia games or hot potato that you can play with the kids.Enjoy this very much and would recommend this to anyone looking for a device like this in their home.,2,2
I bought this for a gift. They seem to like it fine. I have a Dot and a Tap and use them a lot.,2,2
We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends,2,2
"The Echo has the best integration in to Amazon for shopping purposes. It also some excellent integration with other smart devices such has Logitech Harmony and Smart Things. However, it is not quite as intuitive as the Google Home device or able to answer as many questions. So, overall, good for home automation. Not so much for asking general questions.",2,2
Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it,2,2
We bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it works great! We love how it can be set up for different users!,2,2
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,2,2
The echo is so much fun to play with and works great with Amazon and hue products. It's very hard to get it to work with our iPhone and iTunes. I can't figure out how to get my iTunes playlist to work or sync it to my calander from phone. I'm sure it's possible because my tech skills are mediocre at best. Had I known what a pain this would be I would have looked into the google product more closely. The echo itself is a great product but I would not buy it again unless they open it up to other providers services.,1,2
Make sure that you get it soon. They sell out fast!,2,2
I replaced an older Kindle with a new paper white version. What a super improvement.,2,2
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.,2,2
Works awesome. Was hesitant at first not sure how it works but after playing around with it for a while you figure out all the cool things it can do.,2,2
"I love my Kindle!! I have gotten so spoiled that if I can't get a book on my Kindle, I don't read it.",2,2
"Not enough free programs. Even with a subscription to Netflix, etc. you still have to pay for most movies, shows.",1,2
I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers,2,2
This tablet is worth the money you spend. If you looking for your first tablet go ahead and buy it.. You will not regret,2,2
works well with no problems and I am happy with my purchase,2,2
Got this as a gift for my girlfriend who has Amazon Prime and loves binge watching Netflix. It's an affordable and decent quality Netflix machine.,2,2
"I really like the Amazon Fire Tablet because it is easy to navigate, the size of the screen is good, and the weight of the product is not too heavy. I purchased the first one for my husband a couple of years ago, but he broke it and I decided that it would be a great Christmas gift for him since he really enjoyed the first one. Because I really like the product, I have recommended it to several people who have purchased one.",2,2
It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.,2,2
Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter to replace her older version kindle. She loves it.,2,2
I bought this for my mom who is a first time tablet user. It is easy to use and I love that fact that I did not spend a fortune to get her started!,2,2
Kindle has nailed it when it comes to tablets. They are affordable and efficicient for the money.,2,2
This stick is 100 times better than my Chromecast. Dont know how I had not discovered Fire Sticks versatile functionality before.,2,2
I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.,2,2
A great buy for the money. Very easy to set up and use. I recommend to anyone looking for a small tablet.,2,2
Very good for kids. Good quality. We couldn't see any problem.,2,2
Best purchase ever! Love our Echo. Highly recommend the Amazon Echo to anyone,2,2
"I like the echo, however, it needs more instructions as to how to install various music, games, etc.",2,2
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.,2,2
I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it and the games,2,2
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.,2,2
I bought this as an upgrade to the kindle fire that I bought my wife 3 years ago. She says that it is easier to read and loves the smaller size.,2,2
What I expected,2,2
"At first, I was kind of worried that I would not be able to operate it. But it is so easy to use! I also like the parental controls, so I can control what my children watch. The best part of all though is that I don't have to see any infomercials! My family and myself have definitely enjoyed having this product in our home. We have yet to run out of programs and movies to watch!",2,2
I don't really see a difference between the box and the stick. They both buffer. I do like that I expand the memory on the box.,2,2
My kids love it . I love the size and weight . It not easy to broke or crack,2,2
This unit has a speaker built-in. The bullet has to be connected to an external source in order for it to obey the commands. Great purchase,2,2
Amazon makes great tablets and this is at a great price,2,2
