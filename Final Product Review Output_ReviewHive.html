        <h2>Fire HD 8</h2>
        <h3>General Summary:</h3>
        <p>Amazon Fire 8 inch tablet is great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase. Children love to use it...</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>Amazon Fire 8 is a great value for the price. Great for e-reading on the go, easy to use, and great for traveling.</p>
        <h3>Issues:</h3>
        <p>Can't remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. Also can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless rooted.</p>

        <h2>Kindle</h2>
        <h3>General Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pocket to a very small purse. Can read without annoying seatmate with overhead seat light...</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>The Kindle Oasis is the smallest of all the Kindle products. However, the WiFi connectivity is patchy at best.</p>
        <h3>Issues:</h3>
        <p>A three-year-old Kindle outperformed the Oasis. Battery life is better on the older device, and the magnetic connector is poorly designed.</p>

        <h2>Speakers/Streaming</h2>
        <h3>General Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full-size Echo. Itâ€™s great for setting alarms, reminders, and playing music...</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>It's great at voice recognition and playing radio stations. Handy and fun to use.</p>
        <h3>Issues:</h3>
        <p>This is more of a toy unless you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited. It can be a listening device in your home.</p>

        <h2>Fire KIDS</h2>
        <h3>General Summary:</h3>
        <p>This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet purchased, this time in a color other than black. Bundled with the Amazon ecosystem...</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>Screen is too light when set to dark mode for reading. Touch screen does not always respond.</p>
        <h3>Issues:</h3>
        <p>Restarted itself over ten times and has shut off during use. It has to be registered with Amazon to function.</p>
